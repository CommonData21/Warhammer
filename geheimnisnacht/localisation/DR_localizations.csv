Unlike the Tower of Gorgoth, the purpose of the Black Fortress is as a purely military outpost, and is headquarters for the Legion of Azgorh. The legion is a mighty standing army which ranges across the desolation of the southern Dark Lands, escorts the far- flung slave caravans through the Howling Wastes and stands as a bulwark against frequent invasions of Ogres, Orcs and worse from the east.;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus;Most of the Great Tauruses in the plains of Zharrduk come from the breeding pens under the temple of Hashut in Zharr-Naggrund.

The process to find, convince and master a Lammasu will take 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
