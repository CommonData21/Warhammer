lizardman0desc;Lizardmen do not reproduce as other mortals do. Instead, generations of Lizardmen emerge from the vast spawning pools beneath their great temple-cities, fully formed. Some of these spawnings are predetermined by the Great Plan, but at other times, especially when the need is greatest, spawnings may occur suddenly and unexpectedly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lizardman1desc;Welcome, your fate is to birth a new generation of Lizardmen and die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman3desc;Welcome, you are [Root.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman4desc;After centuries of gestation, a new Lizardman emerges from the spawning pools.\nHaving consulted the alignment of the stars and the position of the moon, the Skink Priests determine that [FromFrom.GetSubjectPronoun] shall be named [FromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lizardman_sleepingslann;Sleeping Slann;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman_sleepingslann_desc;To the Slann, time passes more quickly than it does for short-lived creatures, and Slann will regularly slip into extended periods of restful contemplation that might last decades, or even centuries, at a time. They sit unmoving on their stone palanquins or in their Star Chambers, and to an outsider a Slann might appear asleep, or even dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slann_awaken_decision;Awaken to the World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slann_awaken_decision_desc;Awakening to the world allows Slann to communicate directly with their subjects, without going through a Skink Priest first. In game terms, this means you are no longer in a regency.\n\nAwakening will cost 100 piety for every level of sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lizardman_strong_winds_of_chaos;The Winds of Chaos are strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman101desc;Since the Great Catastrophe, the world has been tainted by the mark of Chaos. The immense power and attunement to magic of the Slann makes their minds vulnerable, and when they awaken from their deep contemplation, their spirits become clouded by unreason and uncertainty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman102desc;The Chaos and unpredictability take a steady toll on the mind of the Slann. Only through deep contemplation and avoiding all contact with this tainted world can they protect their souls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman103desc;The deep contemplation of the Great Plan and the will of the Old Ones is soothing: Memories of a world, untainted by Chaos, can set the mind back on its straight path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lighter_sleep_decision;Sleep Lighter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lighter_sleep_decision_desc;The minds of the Slann are ever at risk of corruption and misdirection by the forces of Chaos. Ascending to a lighter level of contemplation will make it easier to completely rouse from your sleep, but you will also be more exposed to the forces of madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman103optA;The Great Plan is soothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lizardman205desc;Great hunting cats, cannibalistic monkey-kin, and the buzzing swarms of enormous insect life makes the jungle a constant battle zone, where survival is an hourly struggle, yet most dangerous of all that hunts beneath the canopies are the giant reptiles.

lizardman261desc;Keeping the dense jungle of Lustria at bay is a constant and dangerous struggle. The jungle expands with unnatural speed, and unless it is regularly cut back by burning and felling trees, it will soon overwhelm any settlement, even those of the Lizardmen - but the workers are at constant risk of being killed by animal and plant alike.

lizardman281desc;The lore of the Old Ones and precious insights into their Great Plan has been preserved on the ancient plaques of the Lizardmen, but many have been lost over the millennia. Sometimes, however, one or two might be recovered in the immeasurable depths of the jungle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lizardman400title;Return of the Chameleon Skinks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman400desc;Long ago, in the time when Chaos came to the world, Oxyotl was one of the rarest breeds of Skink: a Chameleon who could control the colour of his scales at will. He and his band defended Mage-Lord Pocaxalan in his last-ditch effort to save the city with a great spell. But alas, the fickle powers of Chaos tricked Pocaxalan, and he tapped too deeply into the howling Winds of Magic — colossal energies spiralled out of control, ripping holes in the fabric of reality. The Slann and his last protectors were sucked into the Realm of Chaos.\n\nNo more Chameleon Skinks spawned after the disappearance of Oxyotl. Now, somehow, he has returned from the Realms of Chaos, and the Chameleons have begun to appear again. Chameleon Skinks do not dwell within the temple-cities, but instead strike out deep into the Lustrian jungles. During invasions or times of war, Chameleon Skinks appear at army gatherings, putting themselves at the disposal of the Skink Chiefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
