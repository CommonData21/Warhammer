EVTDESCA_spleasure11;You drag the servant on the floor and choke him into your last bag of dust, leaving him shaking and choking. After some time, he finally stops, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure11;How do you like that? What is your *soul* seeing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure12;Each day you give thanks for the inspiration that has led you thus far but although you still feel the thrill when pain dances across your flesh, as time goes on you long to feel something even harsher. As you wonder this things, you find yourself soothed by the chirping of a lovely songbird scampering near your window. For a while you simply delight in its song but eventually your thoughts begin to turn and you start to wonder if perhaps you could inspire it to even greater heights of artistry. How much more beautiful and moving would it be if he went to the same suffering as you subordinate yourself to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure12;I must know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure12;That's base, I'll cleanse this thought from my flesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure12;That's enough, never again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure13;It's growing faint so quickly, but you cannot deny the unique and sublime tone given to birds' notes. It might have been his last song, but you're brought to tears by that very perfection you helped him reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure13;It was... enchanting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure14;You start digging wounds all over your body to punish yourself, but as you go on, you start seeing the art of your work, the passion inside every cut. You quickly grab a mirror and start drawing red lines over your face, ecstatic at the sight of your coming masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure14;Sublime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure15;Your scholarly studies give you plenty of time for peaceful contemplation and the enjoyment of solitude. All alone in the great library, you cannot fail to think of the books as little universes, hanging to your whims, depending on your care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure15;A slight change here or there, and history itself is rewritten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure15;Like the world, they could have little daemons roaming inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure15;They should always be preserved at their best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure16;You smirk, complimenting yourself on your work and passing to the next volume. So many great deeds were committed by your ancestors you didn't know about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure16;It's like bending time itself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure17;Another little miniature is ready and you move to look a good spot for the next. They are so well hidden. The future generations will look at the marvels of these pages and ignore the obscenities laughing at them from the paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure17;It's so delightful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure18;Your days of quiet enjoyment seems to have come to an end. A young apprentice has come to the library to study. A pompous, nagging little brat, asking you for directions every hour, giving you sleazy looks every time he thinks you're not watching him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure18;Your days of quiet enjoyment seems to have come to an end. A young apprentice has come to the library to study. A pretentious, nagging little brat, asking you for directions every hour, outrageously flirting as if her very presence was a gift to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure18;It's a big and ancient library to get lost into...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure18;Let's see if the brat can really handle what it craves for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure18;Walking close to the staircase, I see? Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure18;I'll just have to bear with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure19;Who knows when the poor student is getting out of the old storage room. It's so dark and twisted, how could the brat even end there, you wonder? Here's to hoping the poor soul doesn't get eaten by rats. On the other hand, is muffled screams for help are so soothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure19;It feels like a lullaby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure20;It wasn't so bad. The boy turned out to be experienced at least in something. And going rough with him assured you some days of quiet in the future. You couldn't deny you enjoyed having the chance to choke the little brat, if only for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure20;It wasn't so bad. The girl turned out to be experienced at least in something. And going rough with her assured you some days of quiet in the future. You couldn't deny you enjoyed having the chance to choke the little brat, if only for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure20;A teacher *should* spank their students from time to time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure21;It takes just one little trip. You have to bear the squealing voice of the annoying twerp only up to when the brat's head squashes on the floor below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure21;What a beautiful silence. Poetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure22;You were doing some testing for a new concoction in your laboratory, but something has gone wrong. The rat you used for your experiment has started to slowly and painfully choke after tasting the substance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure22;This needs to be closely observed, yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure22;I'll check on it later, let's try something else first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure22;Better to end the poor creature's suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure23;Despite your careful examination, you cannot find the source of the problem. You have to admit to yourself though, watching the creature gasping in its last breaths from above, like an impassible deity, filled you with a smug sense of satisfaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure23;It's just comes with the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure24;When you return with a new mix, you find out the rat has not yet drawn his last breath. You have it ingest the new substance and, while the creature dies anyway, there's a series of fascinating side-effects accompanying his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure24;How interesting. I'll need another rat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure25;You really looked forward the visit of your distant colleague, you'd had a thrilling correspondence in the last months. Yet, now that you have him here, you are starting to seriously question your judgement. The short-sighted fool is dismissing many of your accomplishments, accusing you of using experiments just as a pretence to kill and torture your test subjects. He has even started to threaten you to call authorities to have you answer of some of these supposed transgressions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure25;Your brain doesn't work. Let me check it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure25;Allow me then to show you this great brew I tested on rats some time ago...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure25;Maybe he's right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure25005;Your colleague finally stops twitching. Another little sowing and he'll be free to go. Of course he was belittling you, the lymph determining his pride and envy were cluttering his brain, you had to remove an entire piece to cure him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure25005;Ssshhh, it's all over now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure26;There's no real difference. Like the rat, the scholar can only look you from below now, in awe and terror, as he chokes on his own blood. The post-mortem reactions seems to be considerably different from your last tests with rats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure26;I should try it with more people then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure27;Since your youth you've been admired for your intelligence. Yet, at the same time, when you've put it into practice, you've always had people complain and snort, opting for the most stupid of decisions. Like the minor noble in front of you right now, bragging about his mediocre accomplishments and calling your wisdom cowardice and self-entitlement. Why people gifted such as you should suffer idiots of that sort?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure27;If you so desire, I'll humiliate you right now in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure27;Speak on, I'll speak later, to the right people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure27;If I answered in kind, I'll be as stupid as he is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure28;When you're finished with him, the courtier is so ashamed he cannot spit a word back. As if it wasn't enough recounting his many failings, you inflame the court against him and he's soon driven out by shouts and threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure28;See?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure29;Seeing you not answering him, the courtier keeps on bragging, finally leaving the room when satisfied with his work. In a few days you send your people in the countryside, spreading enough vicious rumours to utterly destroy his reputation, while at the same time maintaining yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure29;That's where the genius lies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure30;The events at court in the last weeks still haunt you. The thrill, the satisfaction of having the entire court hanging from your lips, then pitted against that insufferable idiot... It wouldn't be bad to feel it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure30;There's plenty of fools, it's only a question of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure30;No, it's not warranted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure31;You are about to send another peasant off to his ironic and well fitted punishment, when one of your spies comes whispering into your ears the bragging courtier is dead by his own hand. He committed suicide to escape the shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure31;Ah! Thus proving once more what a fool he was!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure32;You've always had a sweet tooth and enjoyed foods of all sorts, filling your belly with exotic delicacies gives you an indescribable sense of satisfaction. Yet many at court frown on your taste as inappropriate for an Elven noblewoman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCC_spleasure32;You've always exercised caution and moderation in your meals, as befitting for an Elven noblewoman, yet sometimes it's really hard to say no to some new delicacy, have your stomach growl and be content with roots and vegetables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure32;You've always exercised caution and moderation in your meals, as befitting for an Elven nobleman, yet sometimes it's really hard to say no to some new delicacy, have your stomach growl and be content with roots and vegetables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_spleasure32;Nobody can deny you enjoy a good celebration every once in a while. The thing is, as of late, nothing seems to excite you anymore. After years of experience, it seems you're out of ideas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure32;They're wrong, I don't care!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure32;Maybe I could use a little moderation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure32;A little indulgence won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure32;No, I'm committed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure32;Or maybe not... Just need to dig *deeper*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure32;Well, that happens when you live for centuries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure33;Why did you even doubt yourself? This is the way you like spending your life. Why negate some simple pleasure to try and reach the unattainable ideal of Elven beauty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure33;They are just bones wrapped in judgemental skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure34;Having to let yourself go for a while was nice and all, but now you worry if you're not overdoing with all the large meals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure34;Just one more snack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure35;Your wild feast seems a success, there's all sort of grotesque entertainment going on, things to make an Asur blush. You're having the time of your life, when some stupid page has the gall to voice his absolute repulsion for the whole spectacle, calling your guests weakling sycophants and you a depraved vixen with no shame, as if being the only one in the room to be still dressed gave him more nobility than the one in your blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure35;Pile on him! Pile on him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure35;Maybe we've gone a tiny winy too far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure36;When you wake up in the morning in the garden, naked and wrapped around in a fur cloak by the statue of an Elven God-like, you can barely remember what exactly happened the night before. One thing was clear: it was awesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure36;And whatever happened to that servant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure37;Ignoring the courtiers' prattling seemed to quell your conscience for some time, yet now you are starting to notice how less and less dresses fit you and how tiring moving has become. You can barely fit your behind on the throne any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure37;I don't mind, it's all so good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure37;What am I becoming? Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure38;Why others even care so much? Should you starve yourself like a peasant? They're only envious of you, that's all, they know what they're missing out. Maybe you should show them, some time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure38;Why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure39;The Gods teach moderation and abstinence, but you've always had trouble with it. Is it so wrong to lay down for a while and enjoy a good glass of wine with some friends? Or a barrel of mead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure39;Khaine is not soft on weakness, but you've always had trouble with it. Is it so wrong to lay down for a while and enjoy a good glass of wine with some friends? Or a barrel of mead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure39;You've always followed the austere dictates of the Gods, always kept your mind clear to better fight corruption and Chaos. Yet, sometimes you envy the simple joys of inebriation and carousing. Would it be so wrong to give into it once in a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure39;You've never let your guard down and kept your mind clear and sharp to fight your enemies. Yet, sometimes you envy the simple joys of inebriation and carousing. Would it be so wrong to give into it once in a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_spleasure39;Nobody can deny you enjoy a good celebration every once in a while. The thing is, as of late, nothing seems to excite you anymore. After years of experience, it seems you're out of ideas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure39;I'll drink to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure39;Maybe I should spend more time sober...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure39;I little sip won't really hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure39;Doesn't matter. Can't afford to risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure39;Or maybe not... Just need to dig *deeper*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure39;Well, that happens when you live for centuries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure40;Why worry about the Gods? Surely they drink too from time to time. You remember seeing a statue of one holding a bottle. Or did you put it there one of your nights out? The memory is blurry right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure40;If it fitted, it means *he* wanted it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure41;Since you started drinking, every night is a party, things normally so bland, suddenly become hilarious through the alcohol induced stupor. How could you miss all this for so long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure41;Ah ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure42;Your wild feast seems a success, there's all sort of grotesque entertainment going on, things to make an Asur blush.

EVTOPTAspleasure43;And whatever happened to that servant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure44;As a mockery from the Gods themselves, the sense of inebriation has started to fade in the last days. Doesn't matter how much you drink, you can only get so little enjoyment from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure44;Time to move to something stronger than alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure44;It's probably a sign of mercy. Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure45;You were right, alcohol was just the tip of a great new universe of sensation you've unlocked. There are so many substances, so many ways to see the world... And those narrow-minded fools see it as weakness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure45;I could show them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure46;Asur frown upon the weak temptation of the flesh, yet you've always had a hard time adhering to this principle. Even worst, recently nothing seems to satisfy your lust anymore. Luckily a bard recently come to your court has given you a good impression he could help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Luckily a bard recently come to your court has given you a good impression he could help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure46;Druchii women aren't exactly known for their modesty and you are no exception. Yet your lust has run somewhat dry in the last years, nothing seems to enflame it anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure46;Druchii don't mind employing all of their skills to get the favour of a Sorceress or some other Matriarch, that doesn't mean one should not enjoy the process of getting it. Sadly, as of late, you've had a hard time satisfying your lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_spleasure46;You've always been praised by other Asur for your modesty and for how gracefully you've protected your virtue. Yet, from time to time, you have... yearnings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCF_spleasure46;You've always been praised by other Asur for your clear-mindedness and for how gracefully and respectfully you've treated the opposite sex. Yet, from time to time you wonder how could it be to act as some lesser kins do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCG_spleasure46;Druchii women aren't exactly known for their modesty, your prudish tendencies have always been derided amongst your peers. How could sex ever help a woman in social climbing anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCH_spleasure46;You've always just wanted to mind your own plots and raids, yet you have Witches and Sorceresses of all kinds walking around half-naked day in day out. How is someone to keep his head clear and plan anything in these conditions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure46;I could try a stronger approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure46;The fire will return, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure46;Maybe I could try something more... unorthodox? Just once?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure46;I... no, no, no, I just can't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure47;You push the young man on the floor, sinking your nails into his skin and twisting his arm. The woman joins you with a whip, trying to catch you off guard, but you take her wrist in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure47;You push the young woman on the floor, sinking your nails into his skin and twisting his arm. The man joins you with a whip, trying to catch you off guard, but you take her wrist in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure47;Give it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure47;That's enough for today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure48;You lick the blood off your hands, wrapped around the two young quivering mates. You weren't so sure at the beginning, but now all sorts of nice ideas are coming to your mind for the next sessions, you've been really missing out on something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure48;Maybe I'll pick someone else, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure49;The young man straps you tighter to the bed, spitting on you and glancing at the tools to see what to use next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure49;The young woman straps you tighter to the bed, spitting on you and glancing at the tools to see what to use next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure49;Yes! Yes, tell me how I deserve this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure49;That's too much, stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure50;Once the traveller leaves you tied up in the bed, you are exhausted, but at the same time, you still yearn for more. There must be other interesting ways to experience what you did, you could make some research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure50;Yes, very deep research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure51;You are rightfully and justly feared by your servants and vassals alike, as proper Druchii highborn should. You are just wondering how more enjoyment did you find in exacting your punishments when a servants trips you by accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure51;Several at court seem to dislike your harsh methods. You are just wondering how more enjoyment did you find in exacting your punishments when a courtier dares to speak against your final verdict on a peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure51;You never really liked violence, much to the ridicule of your Druchii peers. When a farmer you just pardoned ends up in court again for stealing and pleads to you, you start seeing their point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure51;You've always kept true to the Gods and exerted kindness and good judgement in your actions. Yet, sometimes, the stupidity of your servants, the mockery of your courtiers, they really push you to edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure51;You miserable wretch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure51;You know what? He's beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure51;That's it! Now you're getting it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure51;Patience, patience...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure52;The courtier cries for forgiveness at every lash, but you still feel like he's not had enough. Exacting the punishment by yourself, without the jailer, makes it feel so much more intimate and satisfying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure52;The servant cries for forgiveness at every lash, but you still feel like he's not had enough. Exacting the punishment by yourself, without the jailer, makes it feel so much more intimate and satisfying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure52;You think it's over? We're just getting started here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure52;I think you've learned your lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure53;You emerge the dungeon soaked in blood and with a heavy breath. The new prisoner is not getting out for some time. The wonders you did to him... It was almost artistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure53;We need to do this more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure54;You have the farmer flogged on the public square. He almost looked surprised at your verdict, probably he hoped to get free again. Not anymore. And besides, watching the executioner rip the flesh from his back is so gratifying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure54;The maiden deserved that punishment, she was clumsy and irresponsible. It was so gratifying and just to give to her her rightful punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure54;It's your fault! You brought this upon yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure54;I'm so sorry, I don't know what came to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure55;Each wound... Is like a painting celebrating justice, it's almost inebriating. Kindness doesn't mean foolishness after all. One needs to be harsh to be loving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure55;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11142;Having to ride out or even walk after eating so much always makes you nauseous. You had also planned a fencing session today, but perhaps you should take a break...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1142;I'm not feeling like doing anything right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1142;Wouldn't be healthy do nothing after eating so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11143;You were planning for a walk after the sixth course, but you're feeling too heavy and tired to walk anywhere right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11144;Your whole life is a failure, there is really no point in doing anything if it's always going to be the wrong thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1144;Better do nothing at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1144;I have to try, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11145;Why even get up of bed when everything and everyone is going to be against you, each day of your accursed life? You might as well lay down and wait for death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11146;Every night is a party, things normally so bland, suddenly become hilarious through the alcohol induced stupor I'm keeping myself into. Despite a few rough mornings, I can barely remember the last time I was sad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1146;Life is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1146;Yeah, but I can barely remember *anything* at all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11147;Another day passes by, spent sitting on my nice soft couch and gorging upon the last delicacies of my cooks. Everything would be fine, if not because I'll have to skip second breakfast tomorrow morning to let the tailor take again my measures for new clothes. Perhaps I can make the servants feed me while he works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1147;He better take them good this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11149;I've lost every appetite. I do nothing, why should I eat anything? I'm not hungry anyway. My body has grown skinnier and sharper as days passed by, even the faintest of the noises and lights bothers me and I find harder to focus for longer times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1149;Am I dreaming right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11154;I know the value of good work and moderation, yet my body is still cursed by past wickedness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1154;I must try to get back into shape, no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1154;I've really a lot to worry about already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11155;The rush of appetite I've been having lately has truly been good to me: I feel less tired, everyone at court says I look healthier and my bones do not stick out anymore from under my skin. I do worry about overdoing though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1155;Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1155;Maybe it's better to return to more frugal habits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure56;You've discovered new depths of pleasure that most people can only dream of. Why not bestow your knowledge to others as well? You've gained the 'Twist' targeted decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure56;Magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1200;Your helmet falls off and the enemy's blade strikes true. When you come to your senses again, your whole face has been covered in bandages, covering a ghastly disfigurement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1200;My face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11182;Lately your sour humour has brought you to contemplate your delicate features, the ones bards used to sing about in your halls. Nothing brings you comfort, your life is an unending cycle of suffering... Nothing good ever happens to you, why then you have such a pretty face? As you look at your reflection, you realize you have a blade in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBspleasure97;[From.GetFirstName] is no stranger to the sublime search for pleasure, taking risks and frequently trying to reach new forms of excess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure97;It can be argued [From.GetFirstName] has a few interesting quirks, but [From.GetSheHe] overall sports a dull character, still too shy to experience true pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure98;Of course, that's how it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure98;I think you're overstating things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure98001;You could hardly believe what your heard when [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] questioned your appearance openly. Now it looks like it won't even be the last time [From.GetSheHe] spouts shrouded insults to your looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure98003;A little experimentation couldn't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCspleasure98005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] caught you completely off guard in the night, hiding inside your chambers and springing out when you were about to sleep. You can barely think of what [From.GetSheHe] tried to do, it was so obscene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBspleasure98005;Wh-?! Get out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure99;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] seems to be responsive to your flattery and, even better, [From.GetSheHe] has shown to accept there might be room for improvement on [From.GetHerHis] looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure99;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] did not care much for flattery, keeping a humble and detached demeanour and giving no importance to the suggestions to improve [From.GetHerHis] looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTCspleasure99003;You're too serious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure99004;Your intricate lies and manipulations caught [From.GetFirstName]'s attentions, [From.GetSheHe] appears eager to learn more of what is to be experienced in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure99004;[From.GetFirstName] was deaf to your subtle attempts to inflame [From.GetHerHis] imagination, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't really seem to care at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure101;[From.GetFirstName] has finally come to accept the research for beauty as the healthy obsession a proper person should groom.

EVTDESCBspleasure101;[From.GetFirstName] has finally started to act properly, surrounding [From.GetHerHim]self with servants and maids to advise [From.GetHerHis] looks, constantly wondering what could improve [From.GetHerHis] features.

EVTDESCCspleasure101;You are seeing some results for your troublesome [GetFromRelation].

EVTDESCDspleasure101;[From.GetFirstName] has started spending some more time checking [From.GetHerHis] hair, choosing some new fabulous clothes under your benevolent guidance, but [From.GetSheHe] shows still too little interest in the process, as if it wasn't the most important thing to worry about during [From.GetHerHis] whole day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure101;As little as it is, [From.GetFirstName] seems to be giving some attention on how to dress and act, but that's no more than the bare minimum one would expect from everyone. There's no passion, no imagination, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't understand the art behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure101;You thought you almost saw [From.GetFirstName] staring at a mirror today, but no such luck, sadly. How can your [GetFromRelation] be still so uncaring about [From.GetHerHis] looks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure101;Somewhere, hidden under layers of indifference, there might be a sense of aesthetic inside [From.GetFirstName]'s soul. There's still a long way to find it, though.

EVTDESCHspleasure101;How frustrating, your [GetFromRelation] seems to care as little about you as [From.GetSheHe] cares about [From.GetHerHis] looks. There seems to be no way to dissuade the [From.GetFirstName] to even look at [From.GetHerHis] reflection from time to time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBspleasure102;There must be some other way, you already spend so much time to look at your best, but, for all [From.GetHerHis] praise, [From.GetFirstName] still thinks there might be room for improvement. Indeed, it would be shameful to stop now, when you already have such an advantageous starting point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure102;At first it was just to experiment some new stuff, but now it has become more of an habit. You've a newfound interest in yourself, how to better look, how to better act around other people, how to sit, how to stand, how to dress.

EVTDESCDspleasure102;Getting powders and perfumes the likes [From.GetFirstName] cannot stop from suggesting might be too much, but you've found a strange comfort in spending some time at the mirror in the morning, making sure look at your best before meeting your courtiers and friends.

EVTDESCEspleasure102;You barely noticed yourself combing your hair today. All this expectation from [From.GetFirstName] and other courtiers must have sneaked inside your head. Still, there should not be anything wrong with a few adjustments from time to time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] sent you some extremely flamboyant clothes as a gift, hoping they would help you understand the need to take care of your looks. Why does [From.GetSheHe] even care what you look like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] would just not stop praising your looks, swearing a little care is all you need to reach true perfection. It is such a strange attitude, to think wasting so much time and wealth on mere appearances could be worth anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] has kept on bothering you with [From.GetHerHis] empty flattering, still hoping you could pick some interest in the empty praises to beauty and fashion. Sometimes you almost wish you understood what this obsession really meant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure103;It's no use changing details, you need to sculpt a better face for yourself. Only then, you will reach true beauty, only then people will stop snickering at your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure103;Every time you feel closer to perfection, [From.GetFirstName] is there, ready to prove you wrong, to point out all the things that you missed, all that still needs to be worked on. How could have you been so blind? The change must be radical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure103;Why is it so hard? You can see [From.GetFirstName]'s harsh words were not uncalled for now, you've started looking for new ways to nurture your look, but for any spot you cover, one more springs out of nowhere, one more thing to trim, adjust, replace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure103;You've started giving greater attention to how you look and act around others, but it's still not enough, you can still hear them snickering behind your back, pointing at all the imperfections and questionable choices in attire you've picked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure103;All this sharp comments, even from other courtiers, are really starting to become unbearable. Do you really look so terrible? Maybe you could spend some time improving your image...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure103;You don't really understand [From.GetFirstName]'s attitude. First [From.GetSheHe] spends hours spitting shrouded insults at you, then [From.GetSheHe] starts spewing advices on how to improve your image.

EVTDESCGspleasure103;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, how out of style are your clothes, how dreadful does your hair look, how much would you benefit from powdering your face. It's such a meaningless concern for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure103;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks and demeanour, as if you would care anything [From.GetSheHe] or any other empty person would think about you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBspleasure103;I still find all this uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure103;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure104;You cannot bear to be yelled at any longer by [From.GetFirstName], spewing how ugly you are yet. You must take drastic measures now. You must change what nature got wrong and move towards beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure104;There was no misunderstanding in [From.GetFirstName]'s yelling this time. Your appearance cannot be improved by things as limited as powders and lotions, it's your very flesh that needs to be treated. Only then you shall be able to reach perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure104;As you leave [From.GetFirstName] chambers after yet another scolding over your sloven looks, you start to understand what you have might be a real problem. You thought you could manage, spend more time, hire some servants to counsel you on the best way to present yourself, but it's clearly not enough. You must be a desperate case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure104;The constant threats of [From.GetFirstName] have been a huge incentive, now you have to spend at least an hour each day on the morning to make sure to look at your best. Even so, that's not even the bare minimum for your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetSheHe]'s insatiable for constant improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure104;You really tried to to be careful, brush your hair and all such frivolous things, but it's still not enough. You were berated once more by your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. What are you supposed to do? Waste days acting like some spoiled princess?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure104;Why is [From.GetFirstName] so upset? It seems like everyday now [From.GetSheHe] has to yell at you for some wrong mannerism or supposedly dreadful hairstyle or any other entirely frivolous matter [From.GetSheHe] may think of. By this point, you wonder if it wouldn't be easier to just entertain [From.GetHerHis] ideas for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure104;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of fashion, making empty threats against you if you persist to keep such an uncaring behaviour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure104;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for slovenliness and ordering you to do something about it, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business how you look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure104;I will change the flesh and reach perfection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure104;I could... spend some more time on this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure104;I still find all this uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure104;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure105;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'s not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about [From.GetHerHis] appearance. There are better things for a man of [From.GetHerHis] stature to do than look frivolous and effeminate, if not outright perverted. It doesn't seem like you'll get anything more from this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure105;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'s not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about [From.GetHerHis] appearance. For a woman of [From.GetHerHis] calibre it would be damning to lose your reason for a self-absorbed life of frivolous nonsense. It doesn't seem like you'll get anything more from this one.You're not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about your appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure105;I'm fine as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure107;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Just the retouching that you needed, a more virile look, the battle-hardened warrior, the scar going just right to emphasize your good features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure107;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Just the retouching that you needed, a mysterious cut, running just along the right places to emphasize your good features, making you so much more interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure107;Yes, this will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10705;It is time to see the results of your gracious and just meddling: [From.GetFirstName] is sporting some nice new interesting looks. How much did he scream to gain his new scar, you wonder? Such a great prize, although coming from a complete different sort of battle, of which you are certainly the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure10705;It is time to see the results of your gracious and just meddling: [From.GetFirstName] is sporting some nice new interesting looks. Normally one would consider such a cut an imperfection, but in the middle of her otherwise plain appearance, it gains such a special quality... In fact you think it might be even giving some value to her other boring features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10705;A good work, but perfection has yet to be reached...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure108;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Proceeding further, adding another line, you start seeing your design taking form. You're like a painter, you finally realize. And your face is still such a blank slate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure108;More red!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10805;What a surprise [From.GetFirstName] revealed himself to be. Here he is, completely transfigured. His face is terrible and in this terror there is something beautiful. Some in the court might think him a madman to do this, but the fact that you alone can truly understand the greatness of his work, makes it even more sublime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure10805;What a surprise [From.GetFirstName] revealed herself to be. Few men would look at her without turning pale. But for you, she's become a forbidden beauty. The mere thought makes your skin crawl with pleasure, to dare looking at the magnificent fruits of your labour...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10805;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure109;The long days of studying in your laboratory, mixing potions and weaving spells have finally come to their fruition.

EVTOPTAspleasure109;Magic solves every problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10905;[From.GetFirstName] has outdone himself. With his arts, he found a way to use the Winds of Magic as the tools to sculpt his face. Only you can see all which has changed, every little detail. So delicate, yet, on the whole, so radical a change. He'll soon be the envy of many young fops in the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure110;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your health.

EVTOPTAspleasure110;Doesn't seem so unreasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure110;I'll take care of my own body, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] has become a real glutton, hardly remaining one day without stuffing [From.GetHerHis] face from morning to evening. At the end of the day [From.GetSheHe] needs servants to carry [From.GetHerHim] to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure111;Now that [From.GetSheHe] started getting a taste of it, your [GetFromRelation] is really appreciating [From.GetHerHis] new diet, carelessly gorging on new delicacies and exotic food every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] has finally started to stuff [From.GetHerHim]self properly, with less encouraging required on your part. Keeping on like this, [From.GetSheHe] will get as plump as you wished [From.GetHerHim] to be.  At the beginning [From.GetSheHe] was a little nauseous, but now [From.GetSheHe]'s started to crave for new dishes and spices every night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure111;Your ceaseless work has certainly resulted in some minor improvement in your [GetFromRelation]'s looks, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't shy from partaking in a large feast once in a while. You can see the first result of your influence in [From.GetHerHis] distended belly and relaxed demeanour, but there's still much to go yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure111;Your efforts managed to get [From.GetFirstName] to assume what you would consider a healthier diet, but this will still not do, [From.GetSheHe]'s still too undernourished, [From.GetSheHe] needs larger meals to recover entirely and gain the more amiable appearance you're looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure111;Paying some kitchen boys to hide some sugar and honey inside your [GetFromRelation]'s bread seems to have been a good idea. [From.GetFirstName] looks already less pale and starving without being any wiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly thin, always refusing any delicacy you have the kitchen boys slip into [From.GetHerHis] table. Going on like this [From.GetSheHe] might actually be getting skinnier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly skinny, you could swear you see bones sticking out under [From.GetHerHis] skin, how could anyone enjoy being such a corpse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure111;*Flatter [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure111;*Shame [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure111;*Bash [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure112;You cannot remember the last time you felt satiated, every second of your waking life is now a constant struggle against the unending hunger [From.GetFirstName]'s honeyed words have bestowed unto you. Luckily, you've found stuffing yourself until you can barely move as a more than pleasant state of being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure112;With your [GetFromRelation]'s kind guidance, your appetite has grown near insatiable. Every dinner is a feast for you and not too rarely you call your servants during the night to ask for more food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure112;[From.GetFirstName]'s insistent suggestions were all that was needed to tease your appetite. You can barely miss a day without trying something new. Your cravings having been refined as well, you can no longer feel content with the frugal meals you enjoyed before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure112;Since you've started following [From.GetFirstName]'s counsel regarding your diet, you've surely felt more relaxed and free in your choice of meals. But your [GetFromRelation] still encourages you each break to try fancy new dishes. At the end of the week you're often feeling bloated and near-sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure112;After [From.GetFirstName]'s numerous concerned talks, you've started to indulge a little every once in a while. Everyone around you swears it has only done good to your health. It's certainly a less stressful attitude, but you still worry it could get out of hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure112;With all the concerned praise you're receiving about your eating habits, you're starting to wonder if you shouldn't be a little less strict, if nothing for the sake of your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure112;It's the third time you see [From.GetFirstName] slipping something near your plate. At this point it would almost feel more unsettling if [From.GetSheHe] were trying to poison you. Naturally, [From.GetSheHe] kept on smiling and praising you for your constraint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure112;Does [From.GetSheHe] makes any sense? First [From.GetSheHe] weaves all sort of praises around you, on how virtuous and temperate you are, but then suggest it might be good for you to not starve yourself as much as you supposedly do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure112;More, I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure112;Nothing wrong in indulging a little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure112;This is disgusting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure112;Enough! The mere thought is making me nauseous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure113;You cannot remember the last time you felt satiated, every second of your waking life is now a constant struggle against the unending hunger [From.GetFirstName]'s poisoned words have bestowed unto you. Luckily, you've found stuffing yourself until you can barely move as a more than pleasant state of being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure113;Following your [GetFromRelation]'s veiled complaints, you've abandoned all caution and let your appetite grown near insatiable. Every dinner is a feast for you and not too rarely you call your servants during the night to ask for more food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure113; You can barely miss a day without trying something new. Your cravings having been refined as well, you can no longer feel content with the frugal meals you enjoyed before. And yet, [GetFromRelation] cannot fail to berate you for still being dangerously moderate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure113;Every time you indulge during a large feast, you end up with your belly stretched and with a sleepy disposition, yet when you voice your concerns [From.GetFirstName] is ready to harshly rebuke them, telling you it is your deviant mindset to see sickness instead of average health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure113;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent veiled insults, you've stopped worrying too much about your meals. After all, if people will complain at you for your moderation and the fasting might be damaging your health, why insist?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure113;With all the shameful quips you're receiving from your [GetFromRelation], you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly depriving yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure113;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, suggesting you might have been in some kind of illness or disgrace to deny yourself even the bare amount of food a person needs to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure113;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks, claiming you to be obsessed with your figure to the point of starving yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure113;More, I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCDspleasure114;With your [GetFromRelation] scolding your for eating too little every night, you've started to ask for larger meals, yet this new diet often leaves you nauseous and tired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure114;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent warnings, you've decided to assume a new diet. After all your health should come before your looks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure114;After all the times your [GetFromRelation] has yelled and warned you about how dangerous it is for you to keep such a debilitatingly frugal diet, you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly depriving yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure114;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of judgement, trying to scare you on what the consequences would be for your body if you keep starving yourself as [From.GetSheHe] thinks you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure114;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for unhealthy diet, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business what do you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure115;But I *am* concerned! Nothing? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure117;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded. Your face lost that sickly pale and hollow look, you don't feel tired riding or holding a weapon, everything looks clearer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure117;Feels good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure11705;Your work has given its fruits: your [GetFromRelation] is finally looking less like a shambling corpse and more like a healthy and strong man, one not likely to be knocked over by a gust of wind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure117005;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure118;You fall back on your chair again, gasping heavily, looking down at the bulging belly peeking from your clothes. [From.GetFirstName]'s influence turned you into a morbid slob, with a chin too many, and soft jiggly arms you can barely raise to put more food in your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure118;After one last exhausting step, you finally reach your chair and sit down, resting your breasts over your belly. [From.GetFirstName]'s influence turned you into a fat cow, your hips have grown so large and plump you can barely move without setting your legs on fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure118;So tired... need a snack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure11805;The endless indulging has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: from being such a plain forgettable man, he's now become way more interesting and big. The way he slowly changed, one roll of fat after the other, the process itself is an art masterpiece that you had the luck to witness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure11805;The endless indulging has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: she started slowly, gaining inches around her chest and sides, then her face and waist, such a magnificent display of excess and decadence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure11805;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure119;You smile faintly, nodding to your servants, so that they can shove another batch of food down your throat. You have no longer the strength to move, nor you wish to.

EVTOPTAspleasure120;Well, I do want to look at my best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure120;That's non of [From.GetHerHis] business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure121;[From.GetFirstName] has become a real model, hardly eating during the whole day, often forcing [From.GetHerHim]self to throw up what little went in [From.GetHerHis] stomach. At the end of the day [From.GetSheHe] has barely the strength to drag [From.GetHerHim]self to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure121;Now that [From.GetSheHe] started understanding the issue, your [GetFromRelation] is really relentlessly following [From.GetHerHis] new diet, eating as little as possible and checking [From.GetHerHis] body constantly for any ill change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure121;[From.GetFirstName] has finally started to regulate [From.GetHerHim]self properly, with less encouraging required on your part. Keeping on like this, [From.GetSheHe] will get as thin as you wished [From.GetHerHim] to be.  At the beginning [From.GetSheHe] was a little recalcitrant, but now [From.GetSheHe]'s started to develop a healthy paranoia around [From.GetHerHis] weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure121;Your ceaseless work has certainly resulted in some minor improvement in your [GetFromRelation]'s looks, [From.GetSheHe] has started to skip meals and throw up entire dishes from time to time.

EVTDESCEspleasure121;Your efforts managed to get [From.GetFirstName] to assume what you would consider a healthier diet, but this will still not do, [From.GetSheHe]'s still too plump, [From.GetSheHe] needs to eat less if [From.GetSheHe] wants to look properly good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure121;Paying some kitchen boys to hide some bile inside your [GetFromRelation]'s stew seems to have been a good idea, at the very least to start triggering some aptly timed nausea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBspleasure122;With your [GetFromRelation]'s kind guidance, you've reached a point where you barely have any appetite. Sometimes servants remind you when it's time to eat, but more often than not you purposefully miss their call as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure122;[From.GetFirstName]'s insistent suggestions were all that was needed to quell your appetite. You can barely miss a week without throwing up a meal. You know every small roll of fat still plaguing your body and are evermore determined to cleanse them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure122;Since you've started following [From.GetFirstName]'s counsel regarding your diet, you've surely felt lighter and quicker, receiving all sorts of praise from other courtiers as well. But your [GetFromRelation] still encourages you each break to skip more and more dishes. At the end of the week you're often feeling starved and nervous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure122;After [From.GetFirstName]'s numerous concerned talks, you've started to restrain yourself a little every once in a while. Everyone around you swears it has only done good to your health. You think you're seeing some improvements as well, ignoring the occasional growling from your stomach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure122;With all the concerned praise you're receiving about your eating habits, you're starting to wonder if you shouldn't be a little more strict, if nothing for the sake of your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure122;It's the third time you see [From.GetFirstName] slipping something near your plate. At this point it would almost feel more unsettling if [From.GetSheHe] were trying to poison you. Naturally, [From.GetSheHe] kept on smiling and asking if you had enough already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure122;Does [From.GetSheHe] makes any sense? First [From.GetSheHe] weaves all sort of praises around you, on how brave you are, not caring for gossip around you, but then suggest it might be good for you to take on a more frugal diet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure122;All good work has good results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure122;I should have more care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCDspleasure123;Every time you skip a meal or throw up one, you end up weakened and with a foggy mind, yet when you voice your concerns [From.GetFirstName] is ready to harshly rebuke them, telling you it is your deviant mindset to see sickness instead of average health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure123;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent veiled insults, you've started worrying a lot about your meals. After all, if people complain there must be something wrong, you might be endangering yourself as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure123;With all the shameful quips you're receiving from your [GetFromRelation], you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly indulging yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure123;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, suggesting you might have been starved as a child to develop such a unhealthily robust appetite now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure123;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks, claiming your carelessness may very well lead you to disastrous consequences for both your health and your popularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCDspleasure124;With your [GetFromRelation] scolding your for eating too much every night, you've started to ask for smaller meals, when not skipping them altogether, yet this new diet often leaves you weakened and nervous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure124;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent warnings, you've decided to assume a new diet. After all you should care about keeping a healthy look...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure124;After all the times your [GetFromRelation] has yelled and warned you about how dangerous and shameful it is for you to keep such a debilitatingly indulgent diet, you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly eating too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure124;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of judgement, trying to scare you on what the consequences would be for your body and your reputation if you keep stuffing yourself as [From.GetSheHe] thinks you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure124;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for unhealthy diet, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business what do you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure125;But I *am* concerned! Nothing? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure127;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded.

EVTOPTAspleasure127;Feels good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure12705;Your work has given its fruits: your [GetFromRelation] is finally looking less like a bloated slob and more like a healthy and strong man, one not to to crush horses under his behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure127005;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure128;You look at your reflection once more, searching for imperfections. There's not many of them any more. With the help of [From.GetFirstName] you've gained a body any mortal would be jealous of. Sure, some may say you look a bit pale and shaky, but it's merely the price for what you've reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure128;You toss away another dress, another of your favourite has become too large for you. You have not much use for so-called 'curves' any longer, thanks to [From.GetFirstName]. You're in such a shape to be the envy of all the women in the realm. It needs to be properly admired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure128;But always be vigilant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure12805;The endless fasting has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: from being such a plain and forgettable man, he's refined his body, tossing away all the rough matter, exalting his true essence.

EVTDESCBspleasure12805;The endless fasting has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: she started slowly, losing inches around her chest and sides, then her face and waist.

EVTOPTAspleasure12805;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure12905;Why did you ever doubt yourself? You thought [From.GetFirstName] could never grow smaller than he already was, but you underestimated your skills and his determination.

EVTDESCCspleasure133;Another poisoned drink and you wake in [From.GetFirstName]'s dungeon. It doesn't bother you that much any more. Keeping your guard up, concocting some ploy yourself, seeing who will fall first, it's an exciting foreplay of its own kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure15705;Yet another drink goes down and your [GetFromRelation] starts singing, or at least attempting to, wrapping an arm around your shoulders to avoid falling face down the table. He's become such a jolly good fellow, although a little moping in the aftermath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsnehekharan14;One of the pretenders has tried to lock you away, far from the throne that rightfully belongs to you. But there are still many servants you could reach with your mind. Slowly, the undead made their way to your dungeon and allowed you to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsnehekharan15;The pretender you decided to lock away has managed to call upon [From.GetHerHis] loyal servants and found a way to sneak away from your dungeons, to plot [From.GetHerHis] campaign for Nehekhara once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsnehekharan18;A Nehekkan tribe has sent word to ask permission to freely roam within the province of [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan18;They are free to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan18;I won't allow this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan18;No vagrant shall ever put foot in this province for as long as I rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsnehekharan19;We can spare something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan19;Get lost, you filthy beggars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan21;For weeks you've received complaints from your subjects regarding the undead troops roaming across your lands on your liege's command. There has been no attack, but the people are unsettled by the skeletons standing sometimes for days, staring at their homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan21;I'll talk with their master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan21;Just pretend they're not there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan22;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent a complaint about your troops. Apparently the glorious armies of Nehekhara stationed to protect [From.GetHerHis] province are unsettling the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan22;I command them to fall back and change their path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan22;I command them to reassure the locals of their good intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan22;This is no concern of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan23;Luckily [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to understand the problem and has had [From.GetHerHis] undead troops discretely fall back, pursuing less exposed patrols, hopefully placating the fears of the living.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan23;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan23005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent an envoy to thank you for your wisdom regarding the issue of your troops scaring [From.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan23005;I still don't see what was scary about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan24;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled otherwise on your plea to retreat some of the undead from your countryside. In fact, there are now frequent reports of people scared away from the province by skeletons trying to speak with them in hissing voices and dead languages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan24;What are they doing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan24005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] is still unsatisfied with your solution to the problem of the craven subjects in [From.GetHerHis] provinces. The living keep on mistrusting and shying away, despite your servants' attempts at reassuring them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan24005;Are they hiding something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan25;You thought the worst when receiving news of the undead approaching directly your subjects, but, astonishingly enough, your people managed to find common ground with the creatures and are starting to get along fine with each other, trusting the immortal soldiers to be ever-watchful over their land and possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan25;Who'd have thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan25005;Just as you assumed, it was only a question of showing the integrity and discipline of Nehekharan troops to reassure the people under [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan25005;It's obvious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan26;The response of [From.GetTitledFirstName] was the same as that of [From.GetHerHis] soldier: silence. You keep on receiving complaints about your subjects, but there's not really much you can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan26;Why they have to be so creepy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan26005;Your vassal finally stopped with [From.GetHerHis] meaningless complaints about your soldiers scaring the local populace. After all, if they've done nothing wrong, what do they have to fear about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan26005;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan27;Since you can remember you've heard incredible and terrible stories about your liege lord and the palace of immortal corpses they live in. Now that there's an opportunity to travel there, you're not sure you want to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan27;I'm not scared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan27;Maybe when I'm older...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan28;Amongst the visitors from the lands of the living under your rule, you've been surprised to see a strange creature. Although covered in flesh, it is smaller than any being you remember, be it human, dwarf or halfling, with short limbs and big eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan28;I shall speak with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan28;A creature so small has to be meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan29;The tall and dessicated undead, wrapped in golden robes, is finally in front of you and starts speaking in a strange and hissing voice, despite [From.GetHerHis] mouth hanging still. The creature leans forward, as if [From.GetSheHe] was about to grab you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan29;H-Hello! How do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan29;*Fight back!*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan29;*Flee*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan30;Not only you discovered to your surprise that the creature is in fact your vassal, [From.GetSheHe] explained you that [From.GetSheHe] is a child, that's why [From.GetSheHe] is so small. That still sounds strange, you don't remember ever being like that, even when alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan30;At least [From.GetSheHe] can talk properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan30005;In the end the undead just wanted to talk with you, [From.GetSheHe] didn't mean any harm and looked just surprised to know you are a kid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan30005;Just for now, though!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan31;The creature was more dangerous than you realized. When you tried to approach it and see what it was, it screamed something and attacked you, shortly after running away with one of your sacred ribs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan31;Come back here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan31005;The undead guards are still looking for you, but you think they'll be more busy recovering the trophy you snatched from [From.GetHerHis] ribcage to worry about you getting out of this tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan31005;I still showed [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan32;At your very sight the little creature started twitching and, before you could even say something, it was running away, screaming with an high-pitched voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan32;What the...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan32005;Luckily, you managed to save yourself from the evil undead before it could suck your soul. You'll never return to this cursed tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan32005;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan33;Don't know why, maybe because of the lack of eyes, but the undead lord has ignored you for all the time you've been in [From.GetHerHis] palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan33;Maybe it's for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan34;You've suffered a great shortage of water this year, with many oasis running low or dry. You've tried to plead to your undead overlords, but they've been silent for the most part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan34;I'll ask directly to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan34;It's no use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan35;You've received word from one of your Nehekkan vassals. [From.GetTitledFirstName] for some strange reason is asking for a great deal of water for [From.GetHerHim]self and [From.GetHerHis] subjects. You do remember water had no flavour for the living either, so you're not sure why [From.GetSheHe] would need any...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan35;If they want to damp themselves, let them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan35;This is nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan36;Fortunately your liege has seen the desperate needs of your tribe and has sent some of [From.GetHerHis] servants to gather water for your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan36;The gods be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan36005;Unfortunately your liege has been as silent as [From.GetHerHis] servants and refused to give any help in the search for water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan36005;We'll find something eventually...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_MUTATION_20006;You awoke with a sense of choking. You gasped, searching for air, but something large and wet is blocking your mouth. It takes some time to realize it is your very tongue, overgrown and extended to unnatural proportions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20007;Your teeth fall one after another. In their place long and rotten fangs sprout, until you can barely speak coherently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20008;More and more eyes open on your face, then your neck and, after that, your whole body is covered by blinking appendages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20009;Something it's irritating your eyes, but the more you scratch them, the more they burn. When you finally find peace, you realize your eyes have turned into bulging reptile-like things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy2;What was that shadow? You could have sworn you heard someone whispering behind your back. Why would someone follow you in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy2;A plot?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy3;People suffer all the time, but why care? As long as you are alright, there's nothing to be sad about. In fact, how could you consider yourself well-being, if not by comparison with those who are not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy3;Their suffering makes me feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy4;All this stress plaguing your mind is just too much. You need something to calm yourself, anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy4;Some herbs might help, maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy5;Incompetent narrow-minded fools might play safe with magic, but you know better by now: one cannot truly master the Winds without taking a few risks. This last experiment might really help you better understanding the arcane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy5;Let's start now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy6;As you expected, the experiment was successful. Each day your mind opens more to the great secrets of the universe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy6;I must know more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy7;You spent an entire night of work for nothing: the secret of this spell still eludes you. All the time wasted for a failure is driving you mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy7;I need to start again! I must know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy8;Collateral damage is inevitable when fighting for control over the great powers of the universe. You just hoped the fire wouldn't spread to yourself as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy8;Aaargh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy9;This is the last time you have to wake up with a damning headache without remembering what you did the previous night. Alcohol is poison and you shall not submit your brilliant mind to it ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy9;I've better things to think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy10;Nobody is truly ever evil, the more you think about it. All people have good reasons for their actions and those who are said to be wicked are just sad and lonely being, who were probably abused when young. Why should you add to their misery by branding them as villains?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy10;There is no evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy11;You've always known to be special, but you are certain now that the Winds of Magic flow through you, granting you powers that mere mortals only dream of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy11;I'm a powerful mage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy12;Most people don't see it, but in the end isn't life one big joke? You can see it now, it might be you just have keener senses or maybe you're the protagonist of this farce. Why else would other people not see the hilarity in murder or the humour in misery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy12;Ah ah ah ah ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy13;For sometime now hardly anything has been able to trigger a response for you. As time passes by not only you do not feel any passion left for your loved ones nor hatred for your enemies, your very skin has started to lose any perception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy13;I feel... nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy14;Life is something miraculous, when you take one, you can feel all of the vibrant passions and dreams of a dying soul. It lasts but a moment, it's never enough to sate your thirst for death. And off you go, searching for the next target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy14;The blood calls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy15;People have always had to look up on you, they know you're better than them in every way and so do you. Are you even one of them, you wonder? Perhaps you are something more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy15;...more than a mortal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy16;You couldn't help it, it was such a beautiful scene... The body moves now, but soon your blade shall turn it into a motionless puppet and shall be able to watch as the soul passes away into the Realm beyond...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy16;Soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy18;The crazed [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has viciously killed your [GetFromRelation]. Rumours say the horrible murder was entirely without motive but the killer's sick pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy18;Madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy19;A single soul is not enough to satisfy you tonight: the will of the Great Reaper pervades you and within a week you've left a trail of blood and mangled corpses all over your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy19;Pile the bodies, create a canal with their blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy20;A single soul is not enough to satisfy you tonight: the will of the Great Reaper pervades you, you summon the Winds of Magic at your fingertips and with a few words an entire building explodes, dragging into oblivion countless lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy20;Kaboom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy21;The crazed [From.GetFirstName] has employed [From.GetHerHis] terrible magic to blow up a building in [From.GetHerHis] own lands, killing many of [From.GetHerHis] subjects in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy21;Madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy22;Why should the thief be hanged when he only stole out of hunger? Is it his fault if he was born poor? Why should the murderer die? Wouldn't that make the executioner a murderer as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy22;Nobody should get punished, ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy23;There was a time when you revelled in other people's suffering, but, the more you look back at those days, the more you feel as if those people only deserved your pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy23;Those poor souls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy24;You just visited your dungeons and saw a prisoner laying, chained on the wall. Why should anybody suffer like that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy24;You'll be freed at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy25;With real power running through your veins you finally realize how deluded you were: only *now* you are a real mage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy25;This is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy26;Even the most powerful wizards make mistakes from time to time. You were sure the potion would react well to your spell, but something might have gone wrong and the philtre just exploded into your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy26;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy28;That disturbing smirk, it unsettles you. [From.GetFirstName] has spent a good chunk of [From.GetHerHis] day mocking you and laughing, claiming your mind has turned into mush and you're no longer good for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy28;This is the third time this week [From.GetFirstName] mocks and trips you, [From.GetSheHe] thinks the ailment affecting your body is something hilarious, the cynical freak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslunacy28;You still have the laughter of [From.GetFirstName] echoing within your mind alongside that maniac's cruel quips on your painful disfigurement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslunacy28;[From.GetFirstName] decided to spend [From.GetHerHis] morning chuckling behind you, poking at your sides and making fun of your generous figure, one shaming snark after the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslunacy28;[From.GetFirstName] decided to spend [From.GetHerHis] morning chuckling behind you, obviously pretending to be concerned about your frail health, not sparing jokes about you being skinnier than a shadow, barely capable of walking two steps without crumbling for exhaustion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslunacy28;This is the third time this week [From.GetFirstName] mocks and trips you, [From.GetSheHe] thinks the illness weakening your body and plaguing your mind is something hilarious, the cynical freak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslunacy28;Has [From.GetFirstName] no heart at all? Your pregnancy is a nightmare as it is without [From.GetHerHim] making fun at you with [From.GetHerHis] cruel jokes, patting your womb and scaring you with all the possible ways your labour could go wrong for both mother and child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslunacy28;As if it wasn't enough trouble for you as it is, [From.GetFirstName] spent last evening cracking jokes about the corruption which is devouring your body, as if your mutations were a light topic of no real importance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslunacy28;What goes [From.GetFirstName]'s mind? The disturbed freak spent all day pointing and laughing at you as if *you* were the insane maniac in the room, rather than [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy28;Enough! Stop it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy29;Watching that miserable fool [From.GetFirstName] trying to get back at you is almost as hilarious as [From.GetHerHis] irredeemably broken mind. You can't stop to chuckle at the thought of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy29;All broken and sore, [From.GetFirstName] is such an easy target. The way [From.GetSheHe] walks, or tries to, it's the most humorous thing you saw in the week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslunacy29;Rarely one has the benefit of entertaining himself with such a fantastic opportunity as [From.GetFirstName]'s mangled body. Tearing scabs off [From.GetHerHis] scourged skin it's just the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslunacy29;How can so few laugh at [From.GetFirstName]? A land whale such as [From.GetSheHe] is, slobbering over the palace all sweaty and bloated... It just calls to be pranked upon, yet people still think you are at fault, for some reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslunacy29;How can so few laugh at [From.GetFirstName]? That frail little thing, with [From.GetHerHis] skin barely covering [From.GetHerHis] bones... It just calls to be pranked upon, yet people still think you are at fault, for some reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslunacy29;Making fun of an ill person like [From.GetFirstName] has double the fun: not only you have to think of new quips to make at [From.GetHerHim], you have to keep a safe distance to avoid sharing [From.GetHerHis] state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslunacy29;Why do other people have to always treat pregnant women with such care, as if they were something precious. Making fun at [From.GetFirstName] swollen body and sickly disposition gave you the best time of this month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslunacy29;Small imperfections are already quite enough a cause for mocking, but a full blown third eye or fifth limb? [From.GetFirstName] just called for it. If [From.GetSheHe] didn't want to be made fun of, [From.GetSheHe] shouldn't have gotten the Dark Gods' attention, it's just that simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslunacy29;[From.GetFirstName] is as crazy as it goes. There's barely any point in mocking [From.GetHerHim], in the end. What else can you say that everybody hasn't thought of already? Still, that does make it quite a challenge to tackle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy29;AH AH AH AH AH AH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy30;What do you have to fear any more? No word or action can make you cry, no wound can inflame your mind with pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy30;Nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy31;Even if somebody was conspiring against you, what would be the result? A dagger through your heart feel less than the morning's air to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy31;I don't care any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy32;You're just so desperate to *feel* something. You thought a blade could pierce deep enough to trigger some response, but, despite your efforts and all the blood spilled, no pain reached your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy32;Is there any point in closing these wounds?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy33;You are marvellous and powerful god, it is time that your people started to treat you as such. They have to bow down and worship you, build statues in your honour, pray for you to judge mercifully their souls once they're dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy33;You are beautiful and powerful goddess, it is time that your people started to treat you as such. They have to bow down and worship you, build statues in your honour, pray for you to judge mercifully their souls once they're be dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy33;Bow before me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy34;Sigmar might have ascended in the long past, after he left this world, but you are a god now, divine blood ruling over this lands. Why should you bow down to one who is your equal, if not inferior to your might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy34;The gods rule from afar, rarely ever talking to their followers, all the gods except you. Your worshippers can see you, they can hear your terrible voice and heed to your commands. Why should you bow down to those who are your equals, if not inferior to your might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy34;I am your Lord and Master!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy35;What even is love? You do not remember any more, nor you feel any passion left for those who claim to love you in return. There's no point in keeping such a charade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy35;I do not love you, nor anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy35005;So far has [From.GetFirstName] descended into madness that [From.GetSheHe] has entirely forgotten what it means to love and be loved. Now [From.GetSheHe] feels nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy35005;The one I loved is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy36;All the anger, all the hatred, they're gone. In the past the mere name of this person would have inflamed your heart, but now, it is not even worth of your attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy36;I have neither enemies nor friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy36005;[From.GetFirstName] has been your rival for a long time, but now the affliction plaguing [From.GetHerHis] mind has wiped away any of [From.GetHerHis] emotion towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy36005;I still don't like [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy37;You've had friends in your life, but now the boundaries of camaraderie have been dissolved. You do not feel like you share anything with this person any more, nor the past experiences mean anything to you any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy37;You are no longer my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy37005;There was a time when you enjoyed [From.GetFirstName]'s company, but now [From.GetSheHe] has grown cold and detached. There's no friendship or interest left within [From.GetHerHis] mind for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy37005;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond14;With the death of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] the Druchii Sorceresses of Ghrond have elected another to lead their cabal: [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond14;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond3;The Sorceresses of Ghrond seem to be mostly approving of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. While not a certainty, [From.GetSheHe] may well be the next to rule over the cabal of Ghrond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond3;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond4;The dreaded black tower of Ghrond has been home of Druchii Sorceresses for millennia. The old elven hags study magic and plot for power within its walls. It's unlikely for a Druchii to rule over them without their approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond4;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1202;Are the creatures tearing reality and coming into your world, or are they a figment of your own imagination, created by the substances running through your veins? In either case, their mere sight is too horrifying to handle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1202;AAAAHH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1203;When you lay down, your mind filled with the strangest stuff, you ponder over the mysteries of the universe. It is amazing what a new perspective can do to widen a person's mindset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1203;The music... of the universe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1204;A thousand enemies hide behind your very shadow. Every time you enhance your senses you can almost see them, lurking outside of reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1204;We must be prepared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1205;Taking a few spoonful of dust is just what you need to calm yourself and let all the worries of the world pass away as your mind is populated by the strangest things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1205;Hello, guys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1206;You must have more stuff, your reserves have been almost entirely depleted, but the supplier is having a hard time finding any new batch this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1206;I don't care how much it costs! Just find more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1206;The waiting is killing me!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1207;It has been sometime since beer and wine lost much of their appeal to you. They all taste stale and you cannot bear the headache coming after each drinking night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1207;I've better things to consume...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1208;Is this even a life? Waiting from one dose to the other, unable to relish any event without your mind being clouded by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1208;No more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1208;I can't... stop it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos1;You could have sworn you had a holding in [Root.GetName], but there's nothing left. As you wonder what could have happened, you see the fortress flying over your head with wings of stone and disappearing in the the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos1;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos2;A servant comes running at you, screaming the ground has turned into a giant mouth and started taking bites off one of your buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos2;That... is expected?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos3;A band of Kurgan has come from afar to pledge its allegiance to you, hoping to share in your glory and the favour of the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos3;Welcome, comrades!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos4;You wake up to see a giant blinking eye staring back at you, mounted on a pair of hairy human legs. When you flinch, the creature jumps off your bed and runs off with a squeaking sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos4;What the...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos5;The influence of Chaos is strong in the province of [Root.GetName]. The great portal is attracting everything towards it and things have started to fall up, rather than down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos5;Hold tight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos6;An indescribable vortex of horror and insanity has opened in the province of [Root.GetName], dragging people and beasts inside to the Realm of Chaos and spewing forth crazed daemons and eldritch beings of horrific might and intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos6;Run for your lives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos8;The great warp rift in [Root.GetName] has swallowed a great deal of troops battling in that land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos8;The great warp rift in [Root.GetName] has swallowed a great deal of troops battling in that land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos9;A giant mound of yellow dirt has grown within [Root.GetName] for a couple of days and now it finally explodes, releasing all sorts of venomous and sickly gasses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos9;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos10;Within a few days an unearthly beautiful garden, filled with fruits and intoxicating rivers of mead has grown in [Root.GetName] bringing pleasure and luxury to its inhabitants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos10;Where...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos11;All the rivers and wells in [Root.GetName] have turned red, their water transformed into blood. It's mere taste seems enough to send even the most peaceful man into a frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos11;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos12;Shadows in [Root.GetName] have stopped following their owners. In fact, they are starting to talk and congregate and many swear they are plotting to kill their masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos12;We must kill them first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos13;A storm of flying fingers has attacked the soldiers in [Root.GetName], causing several deaths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos13;A storm of flying fingers has attacked the soldiers in [Root.GetName], causing several deaths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotentialA3;Since your childhood strange things have kept happening around you. You can't quite put your finger on it, it's nothing concrete, just a vague sensation of weirdness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB3;Since your childhood strange things have kept happening around you. You can't really understand what it is, but sometimes you might understand the meaning behind a animal's cry or seem to move an object without touching it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialC3;You are clearly a wizard in the making: since your childhood you've felt the Winds of Magic and instinctively tried to influence their flow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialD3;When your eyes are closed you can still see the Winds of Magic flowing through the world. Such is your potential in magic that you've already managed to warp reality through your will a couple of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential3;Magic!...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA3005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has shown some crude predisposition in the arcane matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB3005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has shown some basic predisposition in the arcane matters and, if taught well, could become a talented wizard one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialC3005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has shown a clear potential for magic, if taught [From.GetSheHe] could be come a truly powerful wizard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialD3005;Rarely was seen a natural in the ways of magic like your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. With a proper training [From.GetSheHe] could easily become one of the greatest magic users of your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential3005;Something to ponder about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA4;Since your childhood some strange things happened around you. You can quite put your finger on it, it's nothing concrete, just a vague sensation of weirdness... But you know that it's bad news and had no problem hiding it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotentialC4;Since your childhood you've felt the Winds of Magic and instinctively tried to influence their flow.

EVTDESCmagicpotentialD4;Even when your eyes are closed you can still see the Winds of Magic flowing through the world.

EVTOPTAmagicpotential4;Why me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotentialD6;Since your childhood you feared your predisposition to magic would have betrayed you someday. And today that day has come: your liege has found out about your gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential6;Wait! I can explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA6005;It was hard to spot, but you are certain now your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has some faint connection with the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTCmagicpotential6005;This is not a concern of mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential4;I don't care! I won't hide who I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential7;You think you've discovered sound proof of witchcraft perpetrated in the county you're hunting in. It is time to confront the perpetrator of these foul and diabolic rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential7;I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential8;The Witch Hunter [From.GetFirstName] has come to you, accusing you of worshipping the Ruinous Powers and drawing from the nefarious Winds of Magic to perform dark deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotential10;You've finally been discovered for what you are. The Witch Hunters have found out about your dark tidings and your forbidden knowledge and have sieged your palace by surprise, with the help of your liege, to drag you on the stake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential10;I curse you ALL!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WITCH_WITCH;Witch!! Witch!! Witch!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential11;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was burned at the stake on charges of witchcraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential11;I don't care about these things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential11;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.18;You've discovered another amongst your servants, [From.GetTitledFirstName], who thought he could secretely practice the dark arts to grow more powerful than you and kill you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_druchiiinv.18;There is no doubt about it: your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] shows the gift of a sorcerer-to-be. Why else would he have hid this from you if not to plot against your throne?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.18;I shall not die by your sorcery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv.18;The prophecy must not be fulfilled. Not even by you, my son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.19;The Witch-King discovered of your meddling with the dark arts and has quickly sent his best assassins to deal with you. Before you can even react, the shadowy druchii sink their blades in your back time and again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.19;Hhhggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17;[From.GetFirstName] is dragged and bound at the centre of the summoning circle while you start chanting the spell. What daemon should you call forth from the Warp to inhabit [From.GetHerHis] body and devour [From.GetHerHis] soul?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17;I call forth a Flamer of Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos17;I call forth a Plaguebearer of Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos17;I call forth a Daemonette of Slaanesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos17;I call forth a Bloodletter of Khorne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual, but at the last moment you manage to break free of your boundaries and interrupt the ritual. In the backlash of magical fires, you sneak out of the room, fleeing from your captor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17005;That was close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17006;Just a few words before the ritual is complete, [From.GetFirstName] manages to get free of [From.GetHerHis] boundaries, interrupting the ritual. Even worse, the backlash of the broken spell creates enough of a distraction to allow the prisoner to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17006;Gahhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos18;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual, but after the spell has been completed, something seem to go wrong. You feel something crawling inside you, but your body cannot handle the stress and you explode all over the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos18;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos18005;It would seem the recipient was not appropriate. The spell somehow fails and the prisoner explodes into a bloody pulp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos18005;Just... fetch me some new clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos19;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos19;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos19005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts twisting and burning as the Flamer reshapes it in a cacophony of discordant voices and writhing colours. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos19005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos20;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos20;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos20005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts twisting and burning as the Flamer reshapes it in a cacophony of discordant voices and writhing colours. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos20005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos21;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos21;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos21005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts bloating and decaying as the Plaguebearer reshapes it in a flurry of rupturing boils and swarming vermin. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos21005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos22;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCschaos22005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts bloating and decaying as the Plaguebearer reshapes it in a flurry of rupturing boils and swarming vermin. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos22005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos23;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos23;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos23005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts writhing and twisting as the Daemonette reshapes it in a storm of flesh and desire. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos23005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos24;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos24;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos24005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts writhing and twisting as the Daemonette reshapes it in a storm of flesh and desire. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos24005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos25;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos25;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos25005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts tearing itself apart as the Bloodletter reshapes it in a wave of bone and blood. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos25005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos26;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos26;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos26005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts tearing itself apart as the Bloodletter reshapes it in a wave of bone and blood. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos26005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos27;You've prepared the summoning circle and all the needed materials to temporarily open a portal to the Warp and summon a daemon into this world. Which creature should you call?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos27;I call forth a Flamer of Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos27;I call forth a Plaguebearer of Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos27;I call forth a Daemonette of Slaanesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos27;I call forth a Bloodletter of Khorne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos27;I call forth a K'daai of Hashut!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos28;Despite your best efforts, the circle was not strong enough to contain the eldritch energies of the Chaos Realm. The Warp breaks through and a host of cavorting daemons drags you with them to meet their masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos28;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos29;The Flamer slowly takes form before you, a collection of mouths and gooey limbs spitting fire and steaming ichor. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos29;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos30;The Plaguebearer slowly takes form before you, a humanoid creature with rotten skin, skinny limbs and a bloated belly filled with worms and decayed entrails. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos30;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos31;The Daemonette slowly takes form before you, an alluring androgynous creature with pale, silken skin bounded by hard chitin. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos31;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos32;The Bloodletter slowly takes form before you, a screaming red-skinned monster eager for battle.  The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos32;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos33;There's a creature of one of my Master's enemies in this land. I cannot tolerate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos33;Die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos34;We are many and our Master is one. It's time to drag the wizard to our home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos34;Yessss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos35;In your pride you thought the host of daemons in your service would be easy to control. But you were wrong: the creature of the Warp have banded against you and, easily overcoming your powers, they drag you screaming into the Realm of the Dark Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos35;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos38;A ravenous Bloodletter of Khorne has come to you, offering you promises of future conquests and victories and standing ready to do your bidding. Or so it says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos38;A decayed Plaguebearer of Nurgle has come to you, offering its eternal love and plenty of gifts from its Dark Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCschaos38;A luscious Daemonette of Slaanesh has come to you, offering you to lead you through uncharted heights of pleasure and joy. Or so she claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDschaos38;A raving Flamer of Tzeentch has come to you, offering you the power of the endless fires of the Changer of Ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEschaos38;A searing K'daai of Hashut has come to you, offering you the might and riches of the Bullfather's forges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos38;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos38;I don't need you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEMON_HUNT;Daemon Hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos40;There is a nefarious presence plaguing this province. A daemonic being might be at work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos40;It won't hide for longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos42;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has tracked down a daemon hiding in your lands. The Witch Hunter is certain of the existence of the creature and requires your support to trap and cleanse it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos42;Yes, destroy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos42;We have other things to worry about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos43;You've received support from your liege and are ready to spring the trap on the daemon and cleanse the land from its evil influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos43;Let us proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos44;The creature of Chaos revealed itself to be stronger than the Witch Hunter's faith. [From.GetFirstName]'s remains were found scattered in the main square, alongside the entrails of the soldiers you provided [From.GetHerHim] with. There is no trace of the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos44;The gods protect us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos45;A nosy Witch Hunter has managed to find out about your familiar. The daemon revealed itself to be more cunning than [From.GetHerHim] and managed to kill [From.GetHerHim], but it was also put on the run, rescinding the contract which was binding it to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos45;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos46;The accursed mortals have managed to trap you. You fight for as long as you can, but the Witch Hunters are finally able to send you screaming back to the Chaos Realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos46;Grreeaaaahhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos47;An accursed Witch Hunter, [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has managed to trap and destroy your familiar. Luckly for now, the connection between the two of you remains hidden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos47;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos48;After the cleansing of the daemon, you've spent a lot of time trying to figure out who the wicked creature of darkness was serving and you've finally concluded it must have been [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos48;No one can escape the righteous wrath of Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos49;"The Witch Hunter [From.GetFirstName] has managed to rally some ridiculous sort of ""proof"" regarding you consorting with daemons and demands now your confession.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos49;*Appeal to liege*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos49;*Banish the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos49;*Imprison the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos50;[From.GetTitledFirstName] stands accused, by [FromFrom.GetFirstName], on charges of consorting with daemons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos50;Burn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos50;This is just posturing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos50;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in the darkest dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos51005;Papa Nurgle has brought forth good tidings and plentiful bounties for all the good people in the world. Today its servant has decided to honour you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos51005;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos53;[From.GetFirstName] craves to see what your worth is or spill your blood for Khorne. Would you accept the daemon's challenge and fight with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos53;Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos53;You're beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos54;The fight goes on until the daemon is prone on the ground, leaking ichor from numerous wounds. You're tired, but you've learned something more about battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos54;This is your place, vermin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos55;You try your best, but nobody ends the fight as victor. Even worse, the Bloodletter manages to sink its claws deep in your flesh a couple of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos55;Grrnnhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos56;Despite your efforts, the daemon swiftly overcomes your defences and tears your body apart, leaving you near-dead on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos56;Gllfgrrnnthh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos57;You push the daemon back time and again and such is your display of violence that you feel the gaze of Khorne bearing upon you, granting your body new strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos57;Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos59;[From.GetFirstName] awaits you inside your rooms. The daemonette lures you in your bed, whispering honeyed words and promising you to unravel secrets from beyond the veil, if only you'd let her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos59;Yes, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos59;Maybe another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos60;The lips of the daemon feel cold at the first kiss, but they quickly gain an exotic and irresistible flavour. And at every new taste of her, you feel as if your mind is opening to new horizons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos60;More, more!...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos60;Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos61;The whispers within your mind are getting louder. There is no doubt something else has found home within your body and is now struggling to wrestle its control from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos61;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos63;Your blood boils to the point of burning your flesh from the inside out. The daemon inside you keeps on tearing at your soul, taking away whatever is left of your consciousness, until your body has been completely transfigured and there is nothing left of you inside it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos63;One malady after the other, the daemon has completely devastated your body, to the point you yourself can barely recognize it. In the unimaginable suffering you are submitted to by your flesh slowly rotting away and worms feeding off your entrails, you finally accept the daemon's welcoming embrace to oblivion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCschaos63;No mortal indulgence can satiate your cravings any more. The burning desire instilled by the daemon is too much to bear, and it finally breaks your mind entirely as the daemon starts feasting on your soul, one delicious piece at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDschaos63;More and more mutations wreck your body, repurposing it to the daemon's whims. At every change, you lose another part of yourself, until there's finally nothing left but the unholy creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos63;BLOOD AND SKULLS!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos63;The Great Father watches over you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos63;Time for some *real* fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos63;Krlleeaaaach!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos64;A never-ending rage burns through your body. You cannot rest, you cannot sleep, even the slightest wrong sends you into a roaring rampage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos64;Blood! BLOOOD!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos65;You tighten your hold on the courtier's neck, your vision blurred by rage. You don't know who that is or what he did to you, you only know that you won't find peace until you've disembowelled him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos65;Die! Die! DIE!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos66;People feel safe in passing their titles to their children. They grow lazy heirs. Worthless! The only right by blood is the one gained by spilling that of your enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos66;Only the strongest rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos66005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has issued a declaration regarding all [From.GetHerHis] vassals: from this day forward, all of your lands will be inherited only by those who show themselves worthy of them by testing their mettle in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos66005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos67;You first started just to crave more from your favourite sex, but now your lust has grown insatiable. Men, women, children... Nothing can sate your appetites any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos67;More! More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos68;You pin the courtier on the wall and start tearing apart their clothes with inhuman strength. Your vision is blurred and you've yet to realize if you caught a man or a woman, but that surprise will be part of the fun when you slam yourself on them and start having your way with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos68;No, no, don't keep quiet! I liked you screaming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos69;You crawl on the table, reaching for another plate further away from your reach. You've not stopped eating since morning, but the more the pain in your stomach grows, the more you feel compelled stuffing it more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos69;Glmmglrrghh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos70;You've nearly turned blind with the last barrel of wine and cannot stand on your feet any longer, but you still crawl to the next. You've lost your chalice, therefore you just hug the cask and start suckling from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos70;Glglglgllglh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos71;Why do you have to be bothered entertaining all those ugly, old harpies? From now on, only young and beautiful men shall be allowed in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos71;Why do you have to have only ugly, old men as your servant? From now on, only young and beautiful women shall be allowed in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos71;Now we'll finally have someone interesting around here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos71005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that henceforth only men will hold any position of worth inside [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos71005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that henceforth only women will hold any position of worth inside [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos71005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos72;You sneeze once more a copious amount of snot dropping on your chest and dripping all over your clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos72;Bleah...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos73;Scores of boils have appeared all over your body, another of the charming gifts bestowed upon you by the daemon inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos73;Ggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos74;A terrible fever has struck you, weakening your body and giving you horrible visions of the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos74;Ggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos75;You can barely sleep any longer. You can feel the presence of the daemon inside you, whispering, pulling your flesh from the inside, turning it into something monstrous. You can see every little detail of your body which is slowly changing, while being unable to do anything about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos75;No, no, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos76;To each his own, and to everyone something. Your realm will be better off with the lands and title divided unevenly between all. It's certain to create a lot of interesting situations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos76;Indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos76005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed all lands to be split on death of their possessor between all of their heirs, with the main beneficiary being the one with the most support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos76005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos77;Control is but an illusion, why pretend it to exist in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos77;No more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos77005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed all laws of the realm to be null and void. Only the rule of the strong and cunning will determine the loyalty of the servants towards the masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos77005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos78;Everybody expect the firstborn to be the favourite, everybody grooms him to be the best. It is the turn of the youngest now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos78;Truly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos78005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that enceforth all lands shall be inherited by the youngest sons and daughters of the realm and no longer the eldest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos78005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos79;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you feel the daemon being torn from you with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos79;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos79005;Luckly you manage to ambush [From.GetFirstName] with the help of a few guards and start reciting the exorcism as they bind [From.GetHerHim]. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you see the daemon being torn from [From.GetHerHis] with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos79005;Praised be [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you feel the daemon being torn from you with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80005;You can feel it now: the daemon leaving you was nothing but an illusion! The presence has resurfaced again, gnawing at your soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80005;Not again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80006;It would seem your spell did not in fact succeeded in freeing [From.GetTitledFirstName] from the evil presence hiding inside [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80006;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos81;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, but the daemon has sunk its teeth inside you and doesn't let the body go without dragging your soul away as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos81;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos81005;While the exorcism started for the better, the daemon did not leave its host without consequences: the foul creature dragged away the soul of [From.GetTitledFirstName], leaving an empty and lifeless shell behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos81005;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos82;The daemon struggles as the last shred of life leaves your body. The welcoming cold of death is a balm for your mind and you can only laugh at the now-desperate attempts of the ethereal creature to hold onto you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos82;No soul left to eat. Time to leave, pathetic creature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos83;You cannot rest, nightmares of lightning and blood tear your mind every time you try to sleep.\n'YOU DARE TO CLAIM BLOOD AND GLORY WITH COWARDLY MEANS?! HOW CAN YOU KEEP DISHONORING YOURSELF WITH MAGIC!?!.'\nIn every dream the great armoured hound looks down upon you from his throne, berating and belittling you.\n'I HAVE NO USE FOR WEAKLINGS AND DECEIVERS!';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos83;Continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos83;Then take away the stain of magic, Lord of Skulls, so that I may serve you better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos84;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has requested you to prepare a summoning circle, for [From.GetSheHe] desires for you to call a daemon from the Realms of Chaos and bind the creature into [From.GetHerHis] service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos84;Very well, I shall do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos84;No. It's not worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos85;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused your request, pointing you out the dangers of opening a portal to the Realm of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos85;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos86;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted your requests. When the fateful night comes, [From.GetSheHe] prepares the summoning circle and all the needed ingredients and, with you at [From.GetHerHis] side, starts chanting the summoning spell that will bring a daemon into your world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos87;You are not sure of what is happening until too late: the ritual has failed. A host of terrifying daemons break through the summoning circle to drag you and the sorcerer into the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos87;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos88;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a raving Flamer to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos88;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos89;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a decomposing Plaguebearer to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos89;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos90;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind an alluring Daemonette to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos90;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos91;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a brutal Bloodletter to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos91;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GHROND;Ghrond;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic2;By decree of the Witch King all women who show the potential for sorcery must turn themselves in so as to be properly trained in Ghrond, where they study the lore of dark magic in one of the six Covens founded by Morathi. They shall take no man nor bear any children and will live on only to serve the Witch King as his spiritual brides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic2;I will relinquish my possessions and go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdarkelfmagic2;No! I can still hide it... Keep on living like this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic2005;Your attempt at hiding your potential in magic could not go unnoticed forever to the eyes of Naggaroth. The servants of the Witch King have discovered your secret in the end and forced you to go to Ghrond, as it is your duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic20005;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic3;Your daughter shows talent for magic, she has therefore been sent to Ghrond to study with the Covens of Morathi. This is a great honour for your house, as she will now become a bride of the Witch King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic3;A great honour indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic4;Another daughter of a noble house has been recognized as a potential apprentice and has been sent to Ghrond to receive proper teaching and become a Sorceress of the Covens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic4;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic5;The trials of Ghrond are harsh and unforgiving. Only the most gifted and cunning amongst the druchii summoned will manage to achieve mastery over the dark powers and claim their place as Sorceresses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic5;I must keep learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAdarkelfmagic6;You've spent years in the dark tower and all your hard work has finally paid off. You have taken your rightful place as a bride of the Witch King, a Sorceress of the Coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBdarkelfmagic6;Despite your best intentions, you have not managed to pass all the trials and the ruling hags of Ghrond have not deemed you worthy of taking place amongst them. Bound against your will, you shall be turned into a mindless servant, only employed to satiate the Witch King's lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6;So I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdarkelfmagic6;Gooooohhh...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic6005;Your daughter has shown herself to be worthy of the title of Sorceress. She has taken her place within the Covens, bringing more honour to your great House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6005;Good for her. And for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic6006;Your daughter has disgraced herself: she was not able to pass the final tests to become a proper Sorceress and has now been reduced to a worthless mindless slave in the Witch King's harem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6006;Disgusting child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos58;Your Master seems a little lonely. Maybe the mortal would like to spend some quality time with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos58;HmmmHmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HOETH;Hoeth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic2;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] thinks you show talent in magic and has signed you up to study with the Loremasters of Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOTAhighelfmagic2;A great honour!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic3;Every Apprentice in Hoeth has to dedicate himself to countless hours of study to assimilate the centuries of knowledge accumulated in the great libraries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic3;I'll do my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic4;The scion of a noble house shows talent for magic and has been sent to be taught amongst the Loremasters of Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic4;We will welcome this new apprentice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhighelfmagic5;The your long years of study have finally paid off. You can feel the magic within you and have been officially recognized as a respected Asur Mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhighelfmagic5;Despite your efforts, Magic just doesn't seem the right path for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5;I will use these powers wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBhighelfmagic5;I tried my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic5005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has achieved [From.GetHerHis] goal and graduated from Hoeth as an official Asur Mage, a prestigious accomplishment for [From.GetHerHim] and your House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic5006;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was unable to reach [From.GetHerHis] full potential and, after a series of mishaps, has been expelled from Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5006;You're a disgrace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10001;A foul Sorcerer has come to your lands, claiming to have had visions of your future victories from the Gods. The wandering traveller is willing to settle in your court in exchange for a meagre price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10001;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10001;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10002;A Shaman has come to your lands, gaining some favour amongst the locals. The soothsayer is willing to join your court and provide their services for a meagre price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10002;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10002;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10003;A mysterious visitor from the deserts has come to your court. Apparently he is a famous scholar from a faraway land, gifted in the arts of magic and he'd be willing to stay and offer his services to you for a meagre pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10003;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10003;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10004;A travelling Witch has decided to settle at your court. She has requested a few things for her stay, but there's no way of you to refusing her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10004;You... are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice2;Your guardian has the reputation of a powerful magician. And being in the company of such an individual has made you wondering if you could become a mage as well, when you grow up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice2;Can you teach me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice3;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has expressed a desire to learn magic from you as your apprentice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice3;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice3;Not a chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice4;You're taking too long. Perhaps you do not have the gift of magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice4;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice5;[From.GetFirstName] does not think you have what it takes to wield magic and has dismissed your request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice5;But I do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice6;You've been delighted to know your [GetFromRelation] was quite happy to take you as [From.GetHerHis] apprentice and teach you in the ways of the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice6;Yes! I won't disappoint you, I promise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice7;Teaching someone how to feel and channel the Winds of Magic is no easy task. What do you want [From.GetFirstName] to be taught?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice7;I'll teach [From.GetHerHim] about caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice7;A mage must keep an open mind and experiment new things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice7;One cannot channel the arcane powers without focus and discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice7;It is time to test [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should be cautious. Of how tricky and deceitful daemons are and of how so easily a spell can turn in a catastrophe fore everyone involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70001;I'll try and be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70002;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should be bold and inventing. Of how you shouldn't just learn from [From.GetHerHim], but search your own knowledge and create new ways of turning the Winds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70002;I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70003;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should never lose his calm and maintain absolute discipline at all times, for it is a vital component for casting even the simplest spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70003;I'm trying to, really!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice70004;You've spent years over dusty tomes and stinking potions under your [GetFromRelation]'s tutelage, but it has all paid off: you can feel the magic inside you and call it through your will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice70004;You've spent years over dusty tomes and stinking potions under your [GetFromRelation]'s tutelage, but it was all for naught: you're no closer to casting the first cantrip as you were when you started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70004;This is just the beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice70004;Why can't I do it?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice8;Your work with [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has paid off: [From.GetSheHe] has started casting [From.GetHerHis] first spells without any help and is likely to go on [From.GetHerHis] studies without need of your tutelage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice8;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80005;It seems your [GetFromRelation] has succeeded in [From.GetHerHis] apprenticeship and is now a fully qualified mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80005;A great accomplishment for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80006;Your work with [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been in vain: [From.GetSheHe] doesn't appear able to call for the Winds of Magic and might as well have no power at all in [From.GetHerHis] blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80006;What a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80007;It seems your [GetFromRelation] has failed in [From.GetHerHis] apprenticeship and is unlikely to ever become a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80007;What a loss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice9;The Winds of Chaos will favour only the chosen ones of the Gods. To prepare [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] must give in to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and his unholy worship and live by his tenets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice9;I will speak to [From.GetHerHim] of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice9;I will teach [From.GetHerHim] the tenets of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice9;All the same, [From.GetSheHe] needs to learn of incantation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice9;I feel the Gods will soon test [From.GetHerHis] resolve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Changer of Ways and of how he could grant you infinite powers beyond your imagination, if only you were to forsake the faith of your ancestors and embrace him as your only Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Lord of the Flies and of how his warm embrace could grant you great powers and a safe haven from pain and death, if only you were to forsake the faith of your ancestors and love him back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Dark Prince and how he could make you feel better than you ever did in your entire life and show you marvels beyond your comprehension, if only you were to relinquish the faith of your ancestors and bow to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90001;Seems a good bargain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice90001;No, I don't like him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally accepted of how only Tzeentch can lead [From.GetHerHim] to the true mastery over the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally understood and welcomed the unconditioned love of Papa Nurgle in [From.GetHerHis] heart, hoping to receive his gift in return soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally felt Slaanesh's touch and yearns for more, aware of the uncharted heights of pleasure [From.GetSheHe] has still to reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90002;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still stubbornly refusing to accept Tzeentch as [From.GetHerHis] new Master. For some reason [From.GetSheHe] does not understand how only the uncontested Lord of Magic could grant [From.GetHerHim] the power you have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still rudely rejecting Nurgle's love. The Lord of the Flies is magnanimous and will keep bestowing his gifts, as will you, hoping in a change of heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still squeamish about the delights Slaanesh and you are presenting to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90003;Everyone comes around, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90004;It's hard to sleep after all your [GetFromRelation] warns you about everyday. Everyone is everyone's enemy. Power can be gained only through deceit and a cunning mind. You will only ever manage to learn magic from [From.GetHerHim] by stealing [From.GetHerHis] knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90004;It was a little disconcerting at starts, but having to not worry about cuts and illness is such a relief. Your [GetFromRelation]'s god is truly a kind and generous Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90004;It's hard to understand half of the things your [GetFromRelation] tells and does to you, but you've started to gain more and more curiosity as you experienced the delights offered by the Dark Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90004;But what about spells?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice90005;[From.GetFirstName] has finally decided to spare some time to teach you about mustering control over the Winds of Chaos. Most of it is still gibberish to you, but you cannot do much about it, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90005;What does this mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90007;The Changer of Ways has seen fit to bless your pupil with power over reality, as you knew he would. Your [GetFromRelation] is set up on a path to greatness. In fact, maybe you were to generous to the little brat. What if [From.GetSheHe] becomes a threat to your plans, now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90007;Grandfather Nurgle has bestowed a most precious gift upon your apprentice, allowing [From.GetHerHim] to finally have full control over the Winds of Chaos. Soon, your young new friends will share the love of the Lord of the Flies to many more unwilling people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90007;The Serpent is pleased with you and your pupil and has seen fit to grant [From.GetHerHim] a speck of his power to let [From.GetHerHis] fantasies grow wilder still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90007;Success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90008;The plans of Tzeentch go beyond the comprehension of the rabble. Evidently your [GetFromRelation] was not gifted enough and when the Changer of Ways touched [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetHerHis] body and mind could not bear his awesome power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90008;Sadly, for once, Papa Nurgle might have been a little too generous: your [GetFromRelation] has collapsed beneath his many gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90008;Your [GetFromRelation] revealed [From.GetHerHim]self a failure. Your pupil just doesn't seem to have enough imagination for you or your Dark Prince's tastes, despite [From.GetHerHis] many despertate efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90008;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice10;A rush of power goes through your body each time you invoke one of Tzeentch's names, the Winds of Magic ready to bow to your every whim and warp reality at a mere gesture of your hands. Truly, your long years of study with [From.GetFirstName] have paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice10;Many gifts has Grandfather Nurgle bestowed upon you, but it finally came the time for magic to be amongst them. There so much you feel you can do right now and the Lord of the Flies is certain to give you all the time you could wish for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice10;Magic has finally come to you and you could barely spend any time sleeping in the past week: so much to experiment, so much to change and cut and sew with invisible fingers and unearthly precision. The Serpent has given you his greatest tool to express your art across the entire world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10;Finally! Power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice11;Graboliwayghsggrksukaeàfakjcsahxbghhhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice11;Papa Nurgle has blessed you just too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice11;Slaanesh is still unimpressed with you. It looks like you've lost his interest and won't become a mage any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice11;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos83005;Yes...', the vulture muttered, clawing at your shoulders. '...he doesn't need you... and you do not need him. Come with me, little soldier, I will show you how to lead...'\n\n'TRUE GLORY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY FACING YOUR ENEMIES!!'\n\n'I can show you wondrous things and make reality itself bend to your whims.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos83005;Show me your world, o Changer of Ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos83005;Then take away the stain of magic, Lord of Skulls, so that I may serve you better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice12;You've decided to undertake the arduous task of learning magic by your own. You do not know how long will it take, nor if you have the potential to become a mage in the first place, but you're determined to find out. Which branch of magic would you like to focus your efforts on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Ice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Metal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Fire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Shadows;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Beasts;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTGsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Heavens;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTHsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Light;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTIsorcererapprentice12;The Lore of Life;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13;Learning magic with no tutor nor organization of learned experts at your back is no easy task. How would you like to proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice13;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice13;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice13;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13001;The more your personal laboratory increases in size, the higher the chances of unlocking your true magical potential. But you've still a long way to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13001;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13002;You do not know exactly what you are doing, but you hope that by cautious observation of the trial and error method, you will manage to understand the mysteries of the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13002;Now, if I mix this with that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13003;The explosion was luckily contained, but it still managed to wound you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13003;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13004;A potion explodes right into your face, slowly melting your skin off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13004;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice13005;This is likely to be your last experiment. The resulting explosion has destroyed your laboratory and blown away half of your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice13005;Grrlllcht...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice14;It's been hard trying to figure it all out with no materials, no school, no master, but you've made it: you can feel your power and call upon it using the proper words and gestures. You are finally a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice14;You've tried your best, but without a Master you're just running blind. There's no way you'll ever learn magic this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice14;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice14;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons1;As the executioner approaches, the daemon spits a curse in the dark tongue and disappears in a flash, leaving no trace behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons1;Hopefully the headman's axe scared it off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons2;No cell can hold a creature of the warp. A few words and reality bends to facilitate your escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons2;Free again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons3;There are so many mortals to play with. So sad they are so easy to break.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons3;There's more where this came from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons4;You've rallied an experienced group of hunters, hoping they will manage to track and destroy the evil creature infesting your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons4;Go forth and bring me its head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons40001;The hunters have returned to you with the head of the wretched daemon. Your realm is finally free of its evil presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons40001;Rejoice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons40002;The hunters tried their best, but the daemon eluded their traps. It left only their mangled remains as a warning against future attempts to eliminate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons40002;Hmm... hopefully we have reserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons5;The minds of the mortals are easy to manipulate and you take a special delight in pitting those clueless fools one against the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons5;Yeah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons50001;Sometimes you cannot just stand the sight of your friends and colleagues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons50001;I hate you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons6;There are so many people waiting to receive the gifts of the Lord of the Flies. And you have plenty to give yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons6;Gloorrrgh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons60001;You've been feeling rather sick, when suddenly horrible rashes and boils erupt from your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons60001;Gh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons7;The mortals entangled themselves so beautifully with lust and lies. It takes only a little nudge to let the shroud unravel in a wondrous cascade of passion and violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons7;Glamorous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons70001;Each night you dream of your spouse in bed with someone else. Last night, you could see their faces, you are certain now this is no dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons70001;How could you!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons8;Isn't it wondrous to roam free in the lands to spread Chaos wherever and whenever you please?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons8;It sure is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.0;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] approaches you with a hungry gaze and you realize your [GetFromFromRelation] has decided to feast upon you. The vampire seems aware of your fears and tries to calm you down, reassuring you that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] wishes to give you the dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREB.0;When you meet [FromFrom.GetFirstName] in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] room, the reason for your summoning becomes clear: [GetFromFromRelation] wishes to turn you into [From.GetHerHis] thrall and share your friendship forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREC.0;You meet with [FromFrom.GetFirstName] under the pale moonlight and before [FromFrom.GetSheHe] can even speak, you know what [FromFrom.GetSheHe]'s about to ask: your [GetFromFromRelation] wishes you to share in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] love for all eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRED.0;Your [GetFromFromRelation] has called you to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] rooms and is now ordering you to lay down. It appears [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has decided to honour you with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire0;Kiss me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBvampire0;I will never be like you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCvampire0;No! Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREA.11;Your [GetFromRelation] has asked you for the dark gift, and swears eternal fealty if you would but grant this heartfelt desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREB.11;Your friend [From.GetFirstName] has asked you for the dark gift, stating that [From.GetSheHe] wants to follow and assist you beyond death itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREC.11;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has asked you for the dark gift, wishing to share your love for eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRED.11;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has asked you for the dark gift, stating [From.GetSheHe] could not bear the thought of death ending your shared bond and forcing [From.GetSheHe] to leave you alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREA.12;Your [GetFromRelation] bestows the dark gift upon you, and bids you serve [From.GetHerHim] faithfully until the end of your days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREB.12;The bounds of friendship will outlast the fickle nature of life, at least for what concerns you and [From.GetFirstName]. Your [GetFromRelation] has agreed to grant you the dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREC.12;Death shall not part you and [From.GetFirstName]: once [From.GetSheHe] has bestowed upon you [From.GetHerHis] dark blessing, you awake as preternatural creature of the night, to be at [From.GetHerHis] side forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRED.12;Love will conquer death itself: [From.GetFirstName] gave you the dark kiss and you are now bound together as immortal souls, forever sharing your passion for each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBVAMPIRE15;I have no desire to join this bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has refused your request to take [From.GetHerHis] place within your coven, thus staining your reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150001;A fledgling disobeying [Root.GetHerHis] Sire?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.150002;One of your fledglings, [From.GetFirstName], has come to you asking to fully join your coven and be recognized as a member of your ancestral bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150002;We accept you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBVAMPIRE150002;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCVAMPIRE150002;You shall never be of this coven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150003;Your sire [From.GetFirstName] has denied you your request. While the same blood runs through your veins, you're yet to be recognized as part of the coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150003;My time will come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150004;Your sire [From.GetFirstName] has denied you your request. While the same blood runs through your veins, you're yet to be recognized as part of the coven. And by heeding [From.GetHerHim], you might never be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150004;My time will come... one way or another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has accepted your request and allowed you to fully join in [From.GetHerHis] dark coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150006;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has gracefully accepted your offer and joined fully in your ancient coven, completely identifying with your bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150006;As [From.GetSheHe] should have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.2;Your sire has fully accepted you as a member of their coven, yet you've still to receive a proper title within the household's possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.2;I will ask what is my right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.2;I can wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.3;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has come to you requesting a formal recognition by granting [From.GetHerHim] rulership over a part of your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.3;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.3;I shall decide when it is time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.4;[From.GetFirstName] has granted your wish and bestowed upon you a holding to rule in the name of [From.GetHerHis] coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.4;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.5;[From.GetFirstName] has denied your wish, berating you for trying to give [From.GetHerHim] commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.5;But I deserve this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires8;Your [GetFromFromRelation] calls for you with a gentle tone, but when you near [FromFrom.GetHerHim] you realize too late that the dark creature has decided to feast upon your blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires8;No! Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires9;There truly is nothing more delicious than virgin blood. Your [GetFromRelation] has left the world of the living and joined you as child of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires9;Good for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92;The Blood God watches over you from his throne of skulls. What is your offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos92;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos92;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos92;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92001;The Lord of Skulls is pleased with your offering. With a flash of fire and a burst of blood, a daemonic apparition floats down from the sky, allowing you to pick a boon of your choosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92001;Some of your warriors, to crush my enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos92001;Fill me with your strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos92001;Fill me with your energy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92002;The Lord of Skulls must be pleased with you, for after you offering has been burned, a daemonic creature tears its way into reality to offer its services to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92002;You'll follow my orders from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92003;The Blood God favours you. As your offering burns, you feel yourself filling with unholy rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92003;Raaaahhhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92004;The ground cracks and a great river of blood bursts forth to cover you and your followers. Clearly the Lord of Skulls looks you favourably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92004;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92005;The Blood God favours you. As your offering burns, you feel yourself filling with rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92005;Raaaahhhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92006;The smoke of your offering creates intricate designs, you can see the grand design of your patron, finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92006;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92008;Despite your effort, the Lord of Skulls has not reacted to your offering. Perhaps you've not given enough to satiate his thirst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92008;Grmmmh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93;Papa Nurgle is always ready to dispense his gifts to all who are in need. All the same, he's happy to receive offering from his own followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos93;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos93;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos93;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93001;The smoke of your offering covers the field with a noxious fog and a jolly voice resonates in your ears, thanking you for your gift and asking to pick a boon of your choosing in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93001;I wish to receive magic, to better spread your gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos93001;I wish my servants to love me as I love you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos93001;I wish to share your gifts with all of my servants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93002;Papa Nurgle must be really pleased with you, for after you offering has been burned, a daemonic creature claws out of the ground, ready to hug and serve you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93002;I'm so happy to meet you, friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93003;As your offering burns, you feel the love of Nurgle filling your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93003;Why can't we just all get along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93004;The smoke of your offering covers the field with a noxious green fog, undoubtedly proving the Lord of the Flies' unconditional love for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93004;I love you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93005;As your offering burns, you feel Nurgle's generosity filling your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93005;Let everyone share in his gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93006;The fumes of the pyre fill your lungs and you can see the marvellous future the Lord of Flies has in store for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93006;I'm coming Papa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93008;Papa Nurgle has certainly accepted your present, but it could be that others are in greater need of his gifts than you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93008;Don't worry, I'll wait for next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94;The Serpent always thirsts for more delights and greedily takes anything which is offered up. What will you offer Slaanesh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos94;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos94;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos94;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94001;The Dark Prince's voice resonates in your mind, you can feel his touch crawling beneath your skin. Your offering has momentarily pleased your Master, to the point they'll grant you a gift of your choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94001;Grant me mastery over the Winds of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos94001;Make me beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos94001;Heal my body so that I may be whole again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94002;One of the bodies on the pyre stands up and shakes off the flames, shambling away from the others. As it moves, the flesh crawls and flickers and when it reaches you, you realize it is a daemon, a gift from the Dark Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94002;Let us know each other, yes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94003;Like a beacon, the pyre draws a black pegasus to the field. The wild creature descends upon you and bows at your feet, clearly a gift from the Serpent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94003;How about turning around now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94004;The Dark Prince's voice resonates in your mind, you can feel his touch crawling beneath your skin. The Serpent's sweet words clearly show you must be amongst his favourites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94004;Never doubted it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94005;As the flames burn on the pyre, so too does a new lust inflame your soul, rekindled by the Dark Prince's touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94006;The bodies on the pyre create the most interesting shapes while they burn. You can see the artistry of your Master behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94006;Yes... yes it is so clear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94008;You've waited until the last embers have gone cold, but there has been no response from your Master. The Dark Prince must have a poor disposition today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94008;Rats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95;The Changer of Ways is fickle in his rewards and greedy in his requests. What shall you give to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos95;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos95;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos95;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95001;Motes of unnatural light dance over the pyre and you can feel the Architect of Fate is looking at you, ready to grant your heart's desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95001;Magic! Grant me the true power of Chaos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos95001;Knowledge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos95001;More power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95002;One of the bodies on the pyre explodes in a shower of gore. The melted remains come together into an unnatural shrieking mix, a daemonic gift from your Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95002;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95003;As the smoke rises, you can feel the touch of Tzeentch upon you. The Changer of Ways has given you his greatest gift: magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95003;Power over reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95004;The shining smokes and twisting flames undoubtedly show the favour of your patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95004;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95005;The Architect of Fate has looked at your offer and filled your mind with new and greater plans for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95005;Yes, there's greatness in store for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95006;The Architect of Fate has looked at your offer and filled your mind with new and greater plans for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95006;Yes, there's greatness in store for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95008;The Great Plotter's plan is yet to be uncovered. Nothing happened after your offering was sent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95008;Next time... next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos96;The Gods blessed you on the fields of battle today. Your patron's eye is looking right inside your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos96;I am victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos97;Only the best survive the endless trials of the gods. You are more than all the others, you are a true champion of your patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos97;Glorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos98;There is no doubt your god has something special in mind for you. You have received many gifts and have ascended as a chosen servant of your deity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos98;I shall be eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos99;The time has come. You've endured hardship, you've survived all of your patron's generous gifts, you've outdone the efforts of others to please your deity, and he has finally rewarded you with the ultimate gift: you leave your old husk and in a storm of twisting bone and melding flesh you achieve apotheosis and are reborn as an immortal Daemon Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos99;Reaaaahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos100;[From.GetFirstName] struggles desperately within your clutches, but it's too late for [From.GetHerHim]. You open your jaws and suck [From.GetHerHis] delicious soul from the pathetic husk, feasting upon [From.GetHerHis] essence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos100;Marvellous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos101;The terrible daemon who captured you has the worst in store for you: dragging you out of your cage with its claws, the creature reaps your soul out of the body and feasts upon it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos101;Hhhhhhhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos101;The host of daemons emerges from the aether, ready to follow your lead and scourge the lands of the mortals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos101;March!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos102;Your daemonic forces disband, dragged back into the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15;Learning magic with no tutor nor organization of learned experts at your back is no easy task. Necromancy also has quite the bad reputation. How would you like to proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice15;I need to buy more books and materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice15;I'll experiment and see what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15001;The more your personal laboratory increases in size, the higher the chances of unlocking your true magical potential. But you've still a long way to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15001;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15002;You do not know exactly what you are doing, but you hope that by cautious observation of the trial and error method, you will come to understand the mysteries of the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15002;If only there was an easier way to find fresh corpses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15003;It is said that the secret of necromancy lies within the clutches of the undead. Yet, with the proper resources, you might be able to search for a copy of Nagash's books and reach enlightenment without the need to grovel at the feet of a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15003;I shall search for the book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15003;This is beneath me. My will already moves the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice15003;I will ask my dread liege for assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice15003;I can manage on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15004;It has taken a considerable amount of time and money, but finally a copy of the Liber Mortis, written by the Great Necromancer, is within your hands. And yet, now that you can see the ancient book, you are not certain if you could handle the dark secrets hidden within its pages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15004;It's too late to turn back now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15004;I do not dare to open it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15005;The secrets within the works of Nagash might be unbearable for weaker minds, but they could not break your will or your thirst for knowledge. You've discovered more than you could possibly imagine within those old pages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15006;The secrets within the works of Nagash might be unbearable for weaker minds, but they could not break your will or your thirst for knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15006;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15007;You've learned much from the works of Nagash, but the cursed words have slowly wormed their way into your mind, giving you distorted visions of the future and horrid hallucinations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15007;No! Get it away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15008;The secrets of the book were too much for your mind to handle. The dark forces embedded within the cursed writings of the Great Necromancer destroyed your mind and left you a withered husk. Perhaps someone more fortunate will continue your work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15008;Hhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15009;As an ancient King of Nehekhara, the power of the dead is already entwined within your very essence. Thousands of servants awake at your command, answering to the call of their old master. Yet you cannot create more. Perhaps experimenting upon your undead subject might unlock the secret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15009;It is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15009;I shall not harm my loyal servants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15010;Your undead servants have submitted to your wishes, allowing you to perform all sorts of experiments upon them. In the repetitive and orderly fashion, hallmark of the Nehekharan society, you've managed to slowly make progress with your studies. You finally start to see the merits of Nagash's methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15010;Good. Another hundred here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15011;Regardless of the countless servants spent and days of study and experimenting, the secret of Nagash's necromancy still eludes you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15011;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15012;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has gained an interest in necromancy. Clueless as [From.GetSheHe] is on the matters of death and unlife, [From.GetSheHe] has wisely decided to ask you for guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice15012;Sure, I will teach you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15012;I can teach you, but only if you abandon your gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15012;Let me kiss you and you shall know everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice15012;You're not worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15013;[From.GetFirstName] is interested in helping you uncover the secrets of the dark arts, but only if you forsake your gods and bow to the unliving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15013;As you command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15013;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15014;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted your terms and abandoned [From.GetHerHis] failed gods to follow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15014;Good... Let me educate you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15015;[From.GetFirstName] has refused your terms, preferring to cling to [From.GetHerHis] failed gods rather than learn the secrets of eternal life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15015;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15016;[From.GetFirstName] has considered your request and decided to assist you, with no request on [From.GetHerHis] part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15016;A great gift, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15017;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted to help you, but only if you first allow [From.GetHerHim] to bestow upon you the dark gift. As it stands, [From.GetFirstName] assures you your studies will be much easier once you've become an immortal undead as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15017;A great opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15017;I wish to control the dead, not be one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15018;Your [GetFromRelation] has accepted your terms and allowed you in [From.GetHerHis] chambers so that you could give [From.GetHerHim] the dark kiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15019;Your [GetFromRelation] has stubbornly refused your gift, still too attached to [From.GetHerHis] fleeting life to see the wisdom in your offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15019;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15020;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] has not considered you worthy of receiving [From.GetHerHis] ancient knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15020;On my own, then. As usual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice16;It's been hard trying to figure it all out with no materials, no school, no master, but you've made it, you're finally a necromancer. Through your will, the dead can walk and speak once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice16;You've tried your best, but without a guide you're just running blind. There's no way you'll ever learn the secrets of undeath this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice16;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice16;Damnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice17;Your [GetFromRelation] has approached you, offering [From.GetHerHis] knowledge of the dark arts. For some reason [From.GetSheHe] believes you might become a powerful necromancer under [From.GetHerHis] guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice17;Sounds intriguing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice17;Not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice18;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has rejected your offer of power over death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice18;The fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19;Teaching necromancy is no easy task. There are many dangers waiting in the art of summoning the spirits of the dead and sparking a semblance of life within corpses. What should you have your apprentice focus their attention on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19;Caution is what's really important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice19;Daring is what a necromancer needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice19;Focus above everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice19;It is time to test [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should be cautious. One should never be taken by surprise by how easily a spirit could break its chains or an horde lose its purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19001;I'll try and be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19002;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should be bold and daring. You must harden yourself to the horrors you'll witness and never hesitate in your choices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19002;I will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19003;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should always remain calm and maintain absolute discipline at all times, for it is a vital component for casting even the simplest spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19003;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice19004;You've succeeded, you can feel the dark power flowing through your veins, compelling the dead to listen to your commands. You are a necromancer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice19004;Despite your best efforts, it seems necromancy is not the right thing for you. Your many years of study qualified you only for graverobbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19004;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice19004;Damnations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has exceeded your expectations. Under [From.GetHerHis] will, the dead walk again. Your work is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20005;It would seem your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has taken a dark path and mastered the art of necromancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20005;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20006;[From.GetFirstName] revealed [From.GetHerHim]self to be a failure. Despite your efforts, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem capable of mastering the dark arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20006;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20007;It would seem your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]'s attempts at mastering the art of Necromancy ended in failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20007;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires10;As the blood of the sacrifice runs across the altar, you feel the Wind of Death blow stronger. Another step closer to your ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires10;Yes. We need more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires11;You are ready to perform your necromantic ritual. The greater the power you will commit, the greater the horde which will be raised from the grave to obey your commands. At least, until they fall apart once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11;All shall fall and serve me in death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires11;A great host to bring fear to my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires11;A large horde to serve my every need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires11;A small horde, nothing excessive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEsvampires11;Only a few servants for my personal needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11001;Once the spell has been completed, a few hundred skeletons and zombies gather before you, ready to obey your every order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12001;The remaining corpses in your small horde fall back into the ground, devoid of life once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11002;Once the spell has been completed, a few hundred skeletons and zombies gather before you, ready to obey your every order. Looking at them, they seem to be a little more numerous than you expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11002;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12002;The remaining undead in your small horde fall back into the ground, devoid of life once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11003;Once the spell has been completed, thousands of skeletons and other undead gather before you, ready to obey your every order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11003;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12003;Your small horde finally falls apart, once more lacking any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11004;Once the spell has been completed, a few thousand skeletons and other undead gather before you, ready to obey your every order. Looking at them, they seem to be a little more numerous than you expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11004;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12004;Your small horde finally falls apart, devoid once more of any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11005;A great collection of undead of every kind assembles before you, answering your call. The ritual has bore a wonderful harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12005;Your horde of undead finally falls apart, devoid once more of any energy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11006;A great collection of undead of every kind assembles before you, answering your call. The ritual has bore a great harvest. They seem more numerous than you expected, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11006;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12006;Your horde of undead finally falls apart, devoid once more of any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11007;Once your ritual ends all of the land before you has withered and a great host of undead has risen, filling the fields, ready to do your bidding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11007;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12007;Your great horde of undead finally falls apart, devoid once more of any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11008;Once your ritual ends all of the land before you has withered and a great host of undead has risen, filling the fields, ready to do your bidding. They are so many, you can barely see the ground on which they walk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11008;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12008;Your great horde of undead finally falls apart, devoid once more of any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11009;Only the Great Necromancer himself could have outdone such a feat: you've sucked all life from this land and through your great ritual an endless horde of corpses has arisen to follow your whims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11009;To war, my minions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12009;The strain is too much and your titanic horde finally falls apart, returning to the dirt once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11010;Only the Great Necromancer himself could have outdone such a feat: you've sucked all life from this land and through your great ritual an endless horde of corpses has arisen to follow your whims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11010;To war, my minions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12010;The strain is too much and your titanic horde finally falls apart, returning to the dirt once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14;You've studied [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s routine for some time and believe you could hire an agent to slip through to [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] resting place and steal the ring at the right moment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14;My co-conspirators will provide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14;I'll take proper precautions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires14;We need an experienced burglar for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires14;Too risky - I will bide my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14001;This might be the right time. A good thief could sneak and steal the ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14001;Ask the Plot head for funds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14001;I'll take the proper precautions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires14001;We need an experienced burglar for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires14001;Too risky - I will bide my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14002;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], is asking for funds to hire a thief in order to steal [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring while [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] is resting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14002;Very well - too bad I will not see it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14002;Even [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] death is not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14003;[From.GetTitledName] has sent me the necessary funds to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14004;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to fund the master thief needed to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14004;I will pay for it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14004;Forget it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14005;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, the one true time when you look no different from a corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14005;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14005;And yet.. I feel someone's touch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14006;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, but you can still feel the thief's touch on your hand. The vile man has fled the room once you finally awake, but you've smelled his scent before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14006;A million deaths for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14007;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, you can only feel the touch of the thief once he's long gone, along with your ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14007;My ring! My ring!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14008;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, but you can still feel the thief's touch on your hand. With a sudden gesture your claws snap at his neck, raising the pathetic mortal from the ground and holding him still until he whispers terrified the name of his employer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14008;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]? So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14009;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, but you can still feel the thief's touch on your hand. With a sudden gesture your claws snap at his neck, but the wretched mortal is fast enough to flee, albeit empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14009;Who could have sent him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14010;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] has finally found a man skilled and brave enough to try and steal [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14010;He better not screw this up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14011;[From.GetTitledName] approves of your idea to hire an agent to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14011;Make the preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14012;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring is proceeding well. The thief will act on [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] while [From.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] rests within one month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14012;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14013;Success! [From.GetTitledName]'s ring is in your hands. Unfortunately, your complicity was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14013;Good. But... bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14014;Success! That thief was really as skilled as he boasted. [From.GetTitledName] has lost [From.GetHerHis] ring and knows nothing of your involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14014;And now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14015;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] captured the thief and squeezed your name out of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14015;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14016;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] woke before the thief could steal the ring, but my complicity has not been revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14016;We will just have to try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14010;Tell [This.GetTitledName] of the idea to steal [This.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14002;Ask [This.GetTitledName] for funds to steal [This.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14003;[This.GetTitledName] receives the funds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14004;Inform [This.GetTitledName] that I will not pay;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14005;Steal [This.GetTitledName]'s ring during [This.GetHerHis] rest next month;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14011;Approve the plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires13001;The dreaded ring of [From.GetFirstName] now lies within your hands. Through this wicked artifact [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to return from death time and again. Legend has it any vampire could master such a power by wearing this trinket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires13001;And it is MINE now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires13001;I will make sure nobody will ever see this thing again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires13002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has wrested control over the powerful Carstein Ring and now rules over [From.GetHerHis] undead hordes backed by its promise of immortality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires13002;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14017;It has been days now, but still no trace of the thief. The wretched scum must have fled who knows where with your ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14017;A thousand curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TERROR_FROM_DARKNESS;Terror from Darkness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMOUNTS.9;Vampires have been known to use their innate necromantic powers to piece together monstrous creatures that would fly them into the night and upon their prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTMOUNTS.9.b;I've better things to spend time on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMOUNTS.10;After months of hard work, the monster is finally ready. The shrieking abomination craves for the blood of your enemies and is ready to fly you wherever you wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTMOUNTS.9.a;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
