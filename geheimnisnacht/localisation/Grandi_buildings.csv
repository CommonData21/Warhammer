ca_khypris_desc;Khypris (formerly the Capital of the vast Khyprian Empire) is one of the original Kingdoms of the Borderlands, once reaching to the tip of the Black Mountains and comprising of the three provinces of the Northlands, the Heartland and the Westland’s. While the age of the Khyprote empire is long gone, the city still remains a wondrous site on the region, and heavily controls trade in the region.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_argalis;Argalis;;;;;;;;;x
ca_argalis_desc;The City-State of Argalis has had a long and chequered history, first built by the High Elves and named Tor Ancor around -3419. It then fell during the war of vengeance in -1974 when a Dwarf army marched on it following the death of Prince Snorri Halfhand (in a duel with Caledor the 2nd). Only a small colony, the Elves abandoned Tor Ancor to its fate and it was razed to the ground soon after by the vengeful Dwarfs. The city lay in ruins until human tribesmen willingly built on the ruins of the former Elf colony in -1125 – seeking to make their mark as the dominant tribe in the region. Unfortunately this tribe attracted the attention of a Vampire – whose bloodline would later be traced to the Von Carstein’s.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_domatburg;Domatburg;;;;;;;;;x
ca_domatburg_desc;The closest human settlement to Karak Thorinkin and the only major one actually found within the mountain ranges themselves. The Thorinkin maintain a fortress (Khazad Thufill) near to Domatburg helping guard passes through the mountains and the trade road that links the town and the hold together. Relations between the two peoples are very strong with the Thorinkin actually constructing Domatburg’s defences and providing support for the humans against Grobbi that infest the area. The relationship was strong enough that an area between Domatburg and Khazad Thufill was chosen by King Druegar Stromnisson as the site for the Holds new Brewery.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fatandira;Fatandira;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fatandira_desc;Fatandira is a member of the Northern Confederacy City-States – Fatanbad is their sister City State. Due to it's close proximity to Greenskins and the Stygian woods, the population and thus power of the city has declined recently.;;;;;;;;;x
